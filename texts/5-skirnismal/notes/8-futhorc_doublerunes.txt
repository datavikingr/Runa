Freyr ᚦe son of Njorᚦ had sat one day in Hliᚦskjolf and lᛳked over all ᚦe worlds
He lᛳked into Jotunheim and saw ᚦere a fair maiden as ᛲe went from her faᚦers house to her bower
Forᚦwiᚦ he felt a mighty lovesickness
Skirnir was ᚦe name of Freyrs servant
Njorᚦ bade him ask speech of Freyr
He said
1
Go now Skirnir
and seek to gain
Speech from my son
And answer to win
for whom ᚦe wise one
Is mightily moved
Skirnir spake
2
Ill words do I now
await from ᚦy son
If I seek to get speech wiᚦ him
And answer to win
for whom ᚦe wise one
Is mightily moved
Skirnir spake
3
Spᛠk priᚦee Freyr
foremoᛥ of ᚦe gods
For now I fain would know
Why sitteᛥ ᚦou here
in ᚦe wide halls
Days loᛝ my prince alone
Freyr spake
4
How ᛲall I tell ᚦee
ᚦou hero youᛝ
Of all my grief so grᛠt
ᚦough every day
ᚦe elfbᛠm dawns
It lights my loᛝiᛝ never
Skirnir spake
5
ᚦy loᛝiᛝs meᚦinks
are not so large
ᚦat ᚦou mayᛥ not tell ᚦem to me
Since in days of yore
we were youᛝ togeᚦer
We two might ᛠch oᚦer truᛥ
Freyr spake
6
From Gymirs house
I beheld go forᚦ
A maiden dᛠr to me
Her arms glittered
and from ᚦeir glᛠm
ᛲone all ᚦe sᛠ and sky
7
To me more dᛠr
ᚦan in days of old
Was ever maiden to man
But no one of gods
or elves will grant
ᚦat we boᚦ togeᚦer ᛲould be
Skirnir spake
8
ᚦen give me ᚦe horse
ᚦat gᛟs ᚦrough ᚦe dark
And magic flickeriᛝ flames
And ᚦe sword as well
ᚦat fights of itself
Againᛥ ᚦe giants grim
Freyr spake
9
ᚦe horse will I give ᚦee
ᚦat gᛟs ᚦrough ᚦe dark
And magic flickeriᛝ flames
And ᚦe sword as well
ᚦat will fight of itself
If a worᚦy hero wields it
Skirnir spake to ᚦe horse
10
Dark is it wiᚦout
and I deem it time
To fare ᚦrough ᚦe wild fells
To fare ᚦrough ᚦe giants faᛥness
We ᛲall boᚦ come back
or us boᚦ togeᚦer
ᚦe terrible giant will take
Skirnir rode into Jotunheim to Gymirs house
ᚦere were fierce dogs bound before ᚦe gate of ᚦe fence which was around Gerᚦs hall
He rode to where a herdsman sat on a hill and said
11
Tell me herdsman
sittiᛝ on ᚦe hill
And watchiᛝ all ᚦe ways
How may I win
a word wiᚦ ᚦe maid
Paᛥ ᚦe hounds of Gymir here
ᚦe herdsman spake
12
Art ᚦou dᛳmed to die
or alrᛠdy dᛠd
ᚦou horseman ᚦat rideᛥ hiᚦer
Barred from speech
ᛲalt ᚦou ever be
Wiᚦ Gymirs daughter gᛳd
Skirnir spake
13
Boldness is better
ᚦan plaints can be
For him whose feet muᛥ fare
To a deᛥined day
has mine age been dᛳmed
And my lifes span ᚦereto laid
Gerᚦ spake
14
What noise is ᚦat
which now so loud
I hᛠr wiᚦin our house
ᚦe ground ᛲakes
and ᚦe home of Gymir
Around me trembles tᛳ
ᚦe ServiᛝMaid spake
15
One ᛥands wiᚦout
who has lᛠpt from his ᛥeed
And lets his horse lᛳse to graze
Gerᚦ spake
16
Bid ᚦe man come in
and drink gᛳd mᛠd
Here wiᚦin our hall
ᚦough ᚦis I fᛠr
ᚦat ᚦere wiᚦout
My broᚦers slayer ᛥands
17
Art ᚦou of ᚦe elves
or ᚦe offspriᛝ of gods
Or of ᚦe wise Wanes
How camᛥ ᚦou alone
ᚦrough ᚦe lᛠpiᛝ flame
ᚦus to behold our home
Skirnir spake
18
I am not of ᚦe elves
nor ᚦe offspriᛝ of gods
Nor of ᚦe wise Wanes
ᚦough I came alone
ᚦrough ᚦe lᛠpiᛝ flame
ᚦus to behold ᚦy home
19
Eleven apples
all of gold
Here will I give ᚦee Gerᚦ
To buy ᚦy troᚦ
ᚦat Freyr ᛲall be
Deemed to be dᛠreᛥ to you
Gerᚦ spake
20
I will not take

ᚦese eleven apples ever
Nor ᛲall Freyr and I
one dwelliᛝ find
So loᛝ as we two live
Skirnir spake
21
ᚦen do I briᛝ ᚦee

Of old wiᚦ Oᚦins son
From it do eight
of like weight fall
On every ninᚦ night
Gerᚦ spake
22
ᚦe riᛝ I wiᛲ not
ᚦough burned it was
Of old wiᚦ Oᚦins son
In Gymirs home
is no lack of gold
In ᚦe wᛠlᚦ my faᚦer wields
Skirnir spake
23
Seeᛥ ᚦou maiden

ᚦat I hold here in my hand
ᚦy hᛠd from ᚦy neck
ᛲall I ᛥraightway hew
If ᚦou wilt not do my will
Gerᚦ spake
24
For no mans sake
will I ever suffer
To be ᚦus moved by might
But gladly meᚦinks
will Gymir seek
To fight if he finds ᚦee here
Skirnir spake
25
Seeᛥ ᚦou maiden
ᚦis keen bright sword
ᚦat I hold here in my hand
Before its blade
ᚦe old giant bends
ᚦy faᚦer is dᛳmed to die
26

To tame ᚦee to work my will
ᚦere ᛲalt ᚦou go
where never again
ᚦe sons of men ᛲall see ᚦee
27
On ᚦe ᛠgles hill
ᛲalt ᚦou ever sit
And gaze on ᚦe gates of Hel
More loaᚦsome to ᚦee

To men ᛲall ᚦy mᛠt become
28

Men will marvel at ᚦee
More famed ᛲalt ᚦou grow

29
Rage and loᛝiᛝ

Where ᚦou sitteᛥ down

Of hᛠvy hᛠrt
And double dole
30

Or never know a husband
Let loᛝiᛝ grip ᚦee

Be like to ᚦe ᚦiᛥle
ᚦat in ᚦe loft
Was caᛥ and ᚦere was cruᛲed
32
I go to ᚦe wᛳd
and to ᚦe wet foreᛥ
To win a magic wand
I won a magic wand
33
Oᚦin grows aᛝry

Crawliᛝ and craviᛝ in vain
Crawliᛝ and haviᛝ no hope
36

Will hold for ᚦee horns of filᚦ
A fairer drink

ᚦough I did not believe
ᚦat I ᛲould so love
Ever one of ᚦe Wanes

Ere homeward hence I ride
How sᛳn ᚦou wilt

Will Gerᚦ ᚦere grant delight
ᚦen Skirnir rode home
Freyr ᛥᛳd wiᚦout and spoke to him and asked for tidiᛝs
41
Tell me Skirnir
ere ᚦou take off ᚦe saddle
Or fareᛥ forward a ᛥep
What haᛥ ᚦou done
in ᚦe giants dwelliᛝ
To make glad ᚦee or me
Skirnir spoke
42
Barri ᚦere is

A foreᛥ fair and ᛥill
And nine nights hence

Will Gerᚦ ᚦere grant delight
Freyr spake
43
Loᛝ is one night

How ᚦen ᛲall I bᛠr ᚦree
Often to me

ᚦan now half a night of desire
