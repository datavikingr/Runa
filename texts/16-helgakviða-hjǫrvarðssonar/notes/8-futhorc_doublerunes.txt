ᚦe second was called Sᚫreiᚦ and ᚦeir son was named Humluᛝ
ᚦe ᚦird was called Sinrjoᚦ and ᚦeir son was named Hymliᛝ
Kiᛝ Hjorvarᚦ had made a grᛠt vow to have as wife whatsᛟver woman he knew was faireᛥ
He lᛠrned ᚦat Kiᛝ Svafnir had a daughter fairer ᚦan all oᚦers
whose name was Sigrlin
Iᚦmund was ᚦe name of one of his jarls

ᚦere was a jarl called Franmar Sigrlins foᛥerfaᚦer
his daughter was named Alof
ᚦe jarl told him ᚦat ᚦe maidens hand was denied and Atli went home
Atli ᚦe jarls son ᛥᛳd one day in a certain wᛳd a bird sat in ᚦe branches up over him and it had hᛠrd ᚦat his men called Hjorvarᚦs wives ᚦe faireᛥ of women
ᚦe bird twittered and Atli hᛠrkened to what it spoke
It said
1
Saweᛥ ᚦou Sigrlin
Svafnirs daughter
ᚦe faireᛥ maid
in her homeland found
ᚦough Hjorvaᚦs wives
by men are held
Gᛳdly to see
in Glasirs wᛳd
Atli spake
2
Now wiᚦ Atli
Iᚦmunds son
Wilt ᚦou say more
ᚦou bird so wise
ᚦe bird spake
I may if ᚦe prince
an offeriᛝ makes
And I have what I will
from ᚦe house of ᚦe kiᛝ
Atli spake
3
Chᛳse not Hjorvarᚦ
nor sons of his
Nor ᚦe wives so fair
of ᚦe famous chief
Ask not ᚦe brides
ᚦat ᚦe princes are
Fair let us dᛠl
in friendly wise
ᚦe bird spake
4
A fane will I ask
and altars many
Goldhorned cattle
ᚦe prince ᛲall give me
If Sigrlin yet
ᛲall sleep in his arms
Or free of will
ᚦe hero ᛲall follow
ᚦis was before Atli went on his journey
but when he came home and ᚦe kiᛝ asked his tidiᛝs he said
5
Trouble we had
but tidiᛝs none
Our horses failed
in ᚦe mountains high
ᚦe waters of Sᚫmorn
we needs muᛥ wade
Svafnirs daughter
wiᚦ riᛝs bedecked
ᛲe whom we sought
was ᛥill denied us
ᚦe kiᛝ bade ᚦat ᚦey ᛲould go anoᚦer time
and he went wiᚦ ᚦem himself
But when ᚦey came up on ᚦe mountain ᚦey saw Svavaland burniᛝ and mighty duᛥclouds from many ᛥeeds
ᚦe kiᛝ rode from ᚦe mountain forward into ᚦe land and made a nights ᛥay hard by a ᛥrᛠm
Atli kept watch and went over ᚦe ᛥrᛠm
he found ᚦere a house
A grᛠt bird sat on ᚦe housetop to guard it but he was asleep
Atli hurled his spᛠr at ᚦe bird and slew it and in ᚦe house he found Sigrlin ᚦe kiᛝs daughter and Alof ᚦe jarls daughter and he brought ᚦem boᚦ ᚦence wiᚦ him
Jarl Franmar had chaᛝed himself into ᚦe likeness of an ᛠgle and guarded ᚦem from ᚦe enemy hoᛥ by magic
Hroᚦmar was ᚦe name of a kiᛝ a wᛳer of Sigrlin
he slew ᚦe kiᛝ of Svavaland and had plundered and burned his land
Kiᛝ Hjorvarᚦ tᛳk Sigrlin and Atli tᛳk Alof
Hjorvarᚦ and Sigrlin had a son mighty and of noble ᛥature
he was a silent man
and no name ᛥuck faᛥ to him
He sat on a hill
and saw nine Valkyries ridiᛝ one of ᚦem was ᚦe faireᛥ of all
ᛲe spake
6
Late wilt ᚦou Helgi
have hoard of riᛝs
ᚦou battletree fierce
or of ᛲiniᛝ fields
ᚦe ᛠgle scrᛠms sᛳn
if never ᚦou spᛠkeᛥ
ᚦough hero hard
ᚦy hᛠrt may cry
Helgi spake
7
What gift ᛲall I have
wiᚦ Helgis name
Glorious maid
for ᚦe giviᛝ is ᚦine
All ᚦy words
ᛲall I ᚦink on well
But I want ᚦem not
if I win not ᚦee
ᚦe Valkyrie spake
8
Swords I know lyiᛝ
in Sigarᛲolm
Fifty ᚦere are
save only four
One ᚦere is
ᚦat is beᛥ of all
ᚦe ᛲielddeᛥroyer
wiᚦ gold it ᛲines
9
In ᚦe hilt is fame
in ᚦe haft is courage
In ᚦe point is fᛠr
for its owners fᛟs
On ᚦe blade ᚦere lies
a blᛳdflecked snake
And a serpents tail
round ᚦe flat is twiᛥed
Eylimi was ᚦe name of a kiᛝ
whose daughter was Svava
ᛲe was a Valkyrie and rode air and sᛠ
ᛲe gave Helgi ᚦis name and ᛲielded him oft ᚦerᛠfter in battle
Helgi spake
10
Hjorvarᚦ kiᛝ
unwholesome ᚦy counsels
ᚦough famed ᚦou art
in lᛠdiᛝ ᚦe folk
Lettiᛝ fire ᚦe homes
of herᛟs ᛠt
Who evil deed
had never done ᚦee
11
Yet Hroᚦmar ᛥill
ᚦe hoard doᚦ hold
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ ᚦat once
our kinsmen wielded
Full seldom care
ᚦe kiᛝ diᛥurbs
Heir to dᛠd men
he deems himself
Hjorvarᚦ answered ᚦat he would give Helgi a followiᛝ if he fain would aveᛝe his moᚦers faᚦer
ᚦen Helgi got ᚦe sword ᚦat Svava had told him of
So he went and Atli wiᚦ him and ᚦey slew Hroᚦmar and ᚦey did many grᛠt deeds
He slew ᚦe giant Hati whom he found sittiᛝ on a certain mountain
Helgi and Atli lay wiᚦ ᚦeir ᛲips in Hatafjord
Atli kept watch duriᛝ ᚦe firᛥ part of ᚦe night
Hrimgerᚦ Hatis daughter spake
12
Who are ᚦe herᛟs
in Hatafjord
ᚦe ᛲips are covered wiᚦ ᛲields
Bravely ye lᛳk
and little ye fᛠr
ᚦe name of ᚦe kiᛝ would I know
Atli spake
13
Helgi his name
and never ᚦou mayᛥ
Harm to ᚦe hero briᛝ
Wiᚦ iron is fitted
ᚦe princes fleet
Nor can witches work us ill
Hrimgerᚦ spake
14
Who now ᚦou mighty
man art ᚦou
By what name art ᚦou known to men
He truᛥs ᚦee well
ᚦe prince who wills
ᚦat ᚦou ᛥand at ᚦe ᛥem of his ᛲip
Atli spake
15
Atli am I
and ill ᛲalt ᚦou find me
Grᛠt hate for witches I have
Oft have I been
in ᚦe drippiᛝ bows
And to duskriders dᛠᚦ have brought
16
Corpsehuᛝry giantess
how art ᚦou called
Say witch who ᚦy faᚦer was
Nine miles deeper
down mayᛥ ᚦou sink
And a tree grow tall on ᚦy bosom
Hrimgerᚦ spake
17
Hrimgerᚦ am I
my faᚦer was Hati
Of giants ᚦe moᛥ in might
Many a woman
he won from her home
Ere Helgi hewed him down
Atli spake
18
Witch in front
of ᚦe ᛲip ᚦou waᛥ
And lay before ᚦe fjord
To Ron wouldᛥ have given
ᚦe rulers men
If a spᛠr had not ᛥuck in ᚦy fleᛲ
Hrimgerᚦ spake
19
Dull art ᚦou Atli
ᚦou drᛠmeᛥ meᚦinks
ᚦe lids lie over ᚦine eyes
By ᚦe lᛠders ᛲips
my moᚦer lay
Hloᚦvarᚦs sons on ᚦe sᛠ I slew
20
ᚦou wouldᛥ neigh Atli
but gelded ᚦou art
See Hrimgerᚦ hoiᛥs her tail
In ᚦy hinder end
is ᚦy hᛠrt meᚦinks
ᚦough ᚦy speech is a ᛥallions cry
Atli spake
21
A ᛥallion I seem
if ᚦou seekeᛥ to try me
And I lᛠp to land from ᚦe sᛠ
I ᛲall smite ᚦee to bits
if so I will
And hᛠvy sinks Hrimgerᚦs tail
Hrimgerᚦ spake
22
Go aᛲore ᚦen Atli
if sure of ᚦy might
Let us come to Varins cove
ᛥraight ᛲall ᚦy rounded
ribs be made
If ᚦou comeᛥ wiᚦin my claws
Atli spake
23
I will not go
till ᚦe warriors wake
Again ᚦeir chief to guard
I ᛲould wonder not
foul witch if up
From benᛠᚦ our keel ᚦou ᛲouldᛥ come
Hrimgerᚦ spake
24
Awake now Helgi
and Hrimgerᚦ requite
ᚦat Hati to dᛠᚦ ᚦou didᛥ hew
If a siᛝle night
ᛲe can sleep by ᚦe prince
ᚦen requited are all her ills
Helgi spake
25
Tis Loᚦin ᛲall have ᚦee
ᚦourt loaᚦsome to men
His home in ᚦolley he has
Of ᚦe wilddwellers worᛥ
is ᚦe giant wise
He is meet as a mate for ᚦee
Hrimgerᚦ spake
26
More ᚦou loveᛥ her
who scanned ᚦe harbor
Laᛥ night amoᛝ ᚦe men
ᚦe golddecked maid
bore magic meᚦinks
When ᚦe land from ᚦe sᛠ ᛲe sought
And faᛥ ᛲe kept your fleet
ᛲe alone is to blame
ᚦat I may not briᛝ
Dᛠᚦ to ᚦe monarchs men
Helgi spake
27
Hrimgerᚦ mark
if ᚦy hurts I requite
Tell now ᚦe truᚦ to ᚦe kiᛝ
Was ᚦere one who ᚦe ᛲips
of ᚦe warrior warded
Or did many togeᚦer go
Hrimgerᚦ spake
28
ᚦrice nine ᚦere were
but one rode firᛥ
A helmed maid white of hue
ᚦeir horses quivered
ᚦere came from ᚦeir manes
Dew in ᚦe dales so deep
Hail on ᚦe wᛳds so high
ᚦence men ᚦeir harveᛥ have
But ill was ᚦe sight I saw
Atli spake
29
Lᛳk ᛠᛥward Hrimgerᚦ
for Helgi has ᛥruck ᚦee
Down wiᚦ ᚦe runes of dᛠᚦ
Safe in harbor floats
ᚦe princes fleet
And safe are ᚦe monarchs men
Helgi spake
30
It is day Hrimgerᚦ
for Atli held ᚦee
Till now ᚦy life ᚦou muᛥ lose
As a harbor mark
men ᛲall mock at ᚦee
Where in ᛥone ᚦou ᛲalt ever ᛥand
Kiᛝ Helgi was a mighty warrior
He came to Kiᛝ Eylimi and sought ᚦe hand of his daughter Svava
ᚦen Helgi and Svava exchaᛝed vows and grᛠtly ᚦey loved ᛠch oᚦer
Svava was at home wiᚦ her faᚦer while Helgi was in ᚦe field
Svava was ᛥill a Valkyrie as before
Heᚦin was at home wiᚦ his faᚦer Kiᛝ Hjorvarᚦ in Norway
Heᚦin was comiᛝ home alone from ᚦe foreᛥ one Yuleeve and found a trollwoman
ᛲe rode on a wolf and had snakes in place of a bridle ᛲe asked Heᚦin for his company
Nay said he
ᛲe said ᚦou ᛲalt pay for ᚦis at ᚦe kiᛝs toaᛥ
ᚦat eveniᛝ ᚦe grᛠt vows were taken
ᚦe sacred boar was brought in
ᚦe men laid ᚦeir hands ᚦereon and tᛳk ᚦeir vows at ᚦe kiᛝs toaᛥ
Heᚦin vowed ᚦat he would have Svava Eylimis daughter ᚦe beloved of his broᚦer Helgi ᚦen such grᛠt grief seized him ᚦat he went forᚦ on wild paᚦs souᚦward over ᚦe land and found Helgi his broᚦer
Helgi said
31
Welcome Heᚦin
what haᛥ ᚦou to tell
Of tidiᛝs new
ᚦat from Norway come
Wherefore didᛥ lᛠve
ᚦy land O prince
And fared alone
to find us here
Heᚦin spake
32
A deed more evil
I have done
ᚦan broᚦer mine
ᚦou eer canᛥ mend
For I have chosen
ᚦe child of ᚦe kiᛝ
ᚦy bride for mine
at ᚦe monarchs toaᛥ
Helgi spake
33
Grieve not Heᚦin
for true ᛲall hold
ᚦe words we boᚦ
by ᚦe beer have sworn
To ᚦe isle a warrior
wills ᚦat I go
ᚦere ᛲall I come
ᚦe ᚦird night hence
And doubtful muᛥ be
my comiᛝ back
So may all be well
if fate so wills
Heᚦin spake
34
ᚦou saidᛥ once Helgi
ᚦat Heᚦin was
A friend full gᛳd
and gifts didᛥ give him
More seemly it were
ᚦy sword to redden
ᚦan friendᛲip ᚦus
to ᚦy fᛟ to give
Helgi spoke ᚦus because he foresaw his dᛠᚦ for his followiᛝspirits had met Heᚦin when he saw ᚦe woman ridiᛝ on ᚦe wolf
Alf was ᚦe name of a kiᛝ ᚦe son of Hroᚦmar who had marked out a battleplace wiᚦ Helgi at Sigarsvoll after a ᛥay of ᚦree nights
ᚦen Helgi spake
35
On a wolf ᚦere rode
when dusk it was
A woman who fain
would have him follow
Well ᛲe knew
ᚦat now would fall
Sigrlins son
at Sigarsvoll
ᚦere was a grᛠt battle and ᚦere Helgi got a mortal wound
36
Sigar ridiᛝ
did Helgi send
To seek out Eylimis
only daughter
Bid her swiftly
rᛠdy to be
If her lover
alive ᛲe would find
Sigar spake
37
Hiᚦer now
has Helgi sent me
Wiᚦ ᚦee Svava
ᚦyself to spᛠk
ᚦe hero said
he fain would see ᚦee
Ere life ᚦe nobly
born ᛲould lᛠve
Svava spake
38
What chanced wiᚦ Helgi
Hjorvarᚦs son
Hard to me
is harm now come
If ᚦe sᛠ smote him
or sword bit him
Ill ᛲall I briᛝ
to all his fᛟs
Sigar spake
39
In ᚦe morn he fell
at Frekaᛥein
ᚦe kiᛝ who was nobleᛥ
benᛠᚦ ᚦe sun
Alf has ᚦe joy
of victory all
ᚦough need ᚦerefor
is never his
Helgi spake
40
Hail to ᚦee Svava
ᚦy sorrow rule
Our meetiᛝ laᛥ
in life is ᚦis
Hard ᚦe wounds
of ᚦe hero bleed
And close to my hᛠrt
ᚦe sword has come
41
I bid ᚦee Svava
weep not bride
If ᚦou wilt hᛠrken
to ᚦese my words
ᚦe bed for Heᚦin
have ᚦou rᛠdy
And yield ᚦy love
to ᚦe hero youᛝ
Svava spake
42
A vow I had
in my dᛠrloved home
When Helgi sought
wiᚦ riᛝs to have me
ᚦat not of my will
if ᚦe warrior died
Would I fold in my arms
a man unfamed
Heᚦin spake
43
Kiss me Svava
I come not back
Rogheim to see
or Roᚦulsfjoll
Till veᛝᛠnce I have
for ᚦe son of Hjorvarᚦ
ᚦe kiᛝ who was nobleᛥ
benᛠᚦ ᚦe sun
Of Helgi and Svava it is said ᚦat ᚦey were born again
