Of Hjorvarth and Sigrlin
Hjorvarth was the name of a king
who had four wives
one was called Alfhild and their son was named Hethin
the second was called Særeith and their son was named Humlung
the third was called Sinrjoth and their son was named Hymling
King Hjorvarth had made a great vow to have as wife whatsoever woman he knew was fairest
He learned that King Svafnir had a daughter fairer than all others
whose name was Sigrlin
Ithmund was the name of one of his jarls
he had a son called Atli who went to woo Sigrlin on behalf of the king
He dwelt the winter long with King Svafnir
There was a jarl called Franmar Sigrlins fosterfather
his daughter was named Alof
The jarl told him that the maidens hand was denied and Atli went home
Atli the jarls son stood one day in a certain wood a bird sat in the branches up over him and it had heard that his men called Hjorvarths wives the fairest of women
The bird twittered and Atli hearkened to what it spoke
It said
1
Sawest thou Sigrlin
Svafnirs daughter
The fairest maid
in her homeland found
Though Hjorvaths wives
by men are held
Goodly to see
in Glasirs wood
Atli spake
2
Now with Atli
Ithmunds son
Wilt thou say more
thou bird so wise
The bird spake
I may if the prince
an offering makes
And I have what I will
from the house of the king
Atli spake
3
Choose not Hjorvarth
nor sons of his
Nor the wives so fair
of the famous chief
Ask not the brides
that the princes are
Fair let us deal
in friendly wise
The bird spake
4
A fane will I ask
and altars many
Goldhorned cattle
the prince shall give me
If Sigrlin yet
shall sleep in his arms
Or free of will
the hero shall follow
This was before Atli went on his journey
but when he came home and the king asked his tidings he said
5
Trouble we had
but tidings none
Our horses failed
in the mountains high
The waters of Sæmorn
we needs must wade
Svafnirs daughter
with rings bedecked
She whom we sought
was still denied us
The king bade that they should go another time
and he went with them himself
But when they came up on the mountain they saw Svavaland burning and mighty dustclouds from many steeds
The king rode from the mountain forward into the land and made a nights stay hard by a stream
Atli kept watch and went over the stream
he found there a house
A great bird sat on the housetop to guard it but he was asleep
Atli hurled his spear at the bird and slew it and in the house he found Sigrlin the kings daughter and Alof the jarls daughter and he brought them both thence with him
Jarl Franmar had changed himself into the likeness of an eagle and guarded them from the enemy host by magic
Hrothmar was the name of a king a wooer of Sigrlin
he slew the king of Svavaland and had plundered and burned his land
King Hjorvarth took Sigrlin and Atli took Alof
Hjorvarth and Sigrlin had a son mighty and of noble stature
he was a silent man
and no name stuck fast to him
He sat on a hill
and saw nine Valkyries riding one of them was the fairest of all
She spake
6
Late wilt thou Helgi
have hoard of rings
Thou battletree fierce
or of shining fields
The eagle screams soon
if never thou speakest
Though hero hard
thy heart may cry
Helgi spake
7
What gift shall I have
with Helgis name
Glorious maid
for the giving is thine
All thy words
shall I think on well
But I want them not
if I win not thee
The Valkyrie spake
8
Swords I know lying
in Sigarsholm
Fifty there are
save only four
One there is
that is best of all
The shielddestroyer
with gold it shines
9
In the hilt is fame
in the haft is courage
In the point is fear
for its owners foes
On the blade there lies
a bloodflecked snake
And a serpents tail
round the flat is twisted
Eylimi was the name of a king
whose daughter was Svava
she was a Valkyrie and rode air and sea
She gave Helgi this name and shielded him oft thereafter in battle
Helgi spake
10
Hjorvarth king
unwholesome thy counsels
Though famed thou art
in leading the folk
Letting fire the homes
of heroes eat
Who evil deed
had never done thee
11
Yet Hrothmar still
the hoard doth hold
The wealth that once
our kinsmen wielded
Full seldom care
the king disturbs
Heir to dead men
he deems himself
Hjorvarth answered that he would give Helgi a following if he fain would avenge his mothers father
Then Helgi got the sword that Svava had told him of
So he went and Atli with him and they slew Hrothmar and they did many great deeds
He slew the giant Hati whom he found sitting on a certain mountain
Helgi and Atli lay with their ships in Hatafjord
Atli kept watch during the first part of the night
Hrimgerth Hatis daughter spake
12
Who are the heroes
in Hatafjord
The ships are covered with shields
Bravely ye look
and little ye fear
The name of the king would I know
Atli spake
13
Helgi his name
and never thou mayst
Harm to the hero bring
With iron is fitted
the princes fleet
Nor can witches work us ill
Hrimgerth spake
14
Who now thou mighty
man art thou
By what name art thou known to men
He trusts thee well
the prince who wills
That thou stand at the stem of his ship
Atli spake
15
Atli am I
and ill shalt thou find me
Great hate for witches I have
Oft have I been
in the dripping bows
And to duskriders death have brought
16
Corpsehungry giantess
how art thou called
Say witch who thy father was
Nine miles deeper
down mayst thou sink
And a tree grow tall on thy bosom
Hrimgerth spake
17
Hrimgerth am I
my father was Hati
Of giants the most in might
Many a woman
he won from her home
Ere Helgi hewed him down
Atli spake
18
Witch in front
of the ship thou wast
And lay before the fjord
To Ron wouldst have given
the rulers men
If a spear had not stuck in thy flesh
Hrimgerth spake
19
Dull art thou Atli
thou dreamest methinks
The lids lie over thine eyes
By the leaders ships
my mother lay
Hlothvarths sons on the sea I slew
20
Thou wouldst neigh Atli
but gelded thou art
See Hrimgerth hoists her tail
In thy hinder end
is thy heart methinks
Though thy speech is a stallions cry
Atli spake
21
A stallion I seem
if thou seekest to try me
And I leap to land from the sea
I shall smite thee to bits
if so I will
And heavy sinks Hrimgerths tail
Hrimgerth spake
22
Go ashore then Atli
if sure of thy might
Let us come to Varins cove
Straight shall thy rounded
ribs be made
If thou comest within my claws
Atli spake
23
I will not go
till the warriors wake
Again their chief to guard
I should wonder not
foul witch if up
From beneath our keel thou shouldst come
Hrimgerth spake
24
Awake now Helgi
and Hrimgerth requite
That Hati to death thou didst hew
If a single night
she can sleep by the prince
Then requited are all her ills
Helgi spake
25
Tis Lothin shall have thee
thourt loathsome to men
His home in Tholley he has
Of the wilddwellers worst
is the giant wise
He is meet as a mate for thee
Hrimgerth spake
26
More thou lovest her
who scanned the harbor
Last night among the men
The golddecked maid
bore magic methinks
When the land from the sea she sought
And fast she kept your fleet
She alone is to blame
that I may not bring
Death to the monarchs men
Helgi spake
27
Hrimgerth mark
if thy hurts I requite
Tell now the truth to the king
Was there one who the ships
of the warrior warded
Or did many together go
Hrimgerth spake
28
Thrice nine there were
but one rode first
A helmed maid white of hue
Their horses quivered
there came from their manes
Dew in the dales so deep
Hail on the woods so high
Thence men their harvest have
But ill was the sight I saw
Atli spake
29
Look eastward Hrimgerth
for Helgi has struck thee
Down with the runes of death
Safe in harbor floats
the princes fleet
And safe are the monarchs men
Helgi spake
30
It is day Hrimgerth
for Atli held thee
Till now thy life thou must lose
As a harbor mark
men shall mock at thee
Where in stone thou shalt ever stand
King Helgi was a mighty warrior
He came to King Eylimi and sought the hand of his daughter Svava
Then Helgi and Svava exchanged vows and greatly they loved each other
Svava was at home with her father while Helgi was in the field
Svava was still a Valkyrie as before
Hethin was at home with his father King Hjorvarth in Norway
Hethin was coming home alone from the forest one Yuleeve and found a trollwoman
she rode on a wolf and had snakes in place of a bridle She asked Hethin for his company
Nay said he
She said Thou shalt pay for this at the kings toast
That evening the great vows were taken
the sacred boar was brought in
the men laid their hands thereon and took their vows at the kings toast
Hethin vowed that he would have Svava Eylimis daughter the beloved of his brother Helgi then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land and found Helgi his brother
Helgi said
31
Welcome Hethin
what hast thou to tell
Of tidings new
that from Norway come
Wherefore didst leave
thy land O prince
And fared alone
to find us here
Hethin spake
32
A deed more evil
I have done
Than brother mine
thou eer canst mend
For I have chosen
the child of the king
Thy bride for mine
at the monarchs toast
Helgi spake
33
Grieve not Hethin
for true shall hold
The words we both
by the beer have sworn
To the isle a warrior
wills that I go
There shall I come
the third night hence
And doubtful must be
my coming back
So may all be well
if fate so wills
Hethin spake
34
Thou saidst once Helgi
that Hethin was
A friend full good
and gifts didst give him
More seemly it were
thy sword to redden
Than friendship thus
to thy foe to give
Helgi spoke thus because he foresaw his death for his followingspirits had met Hethin when he saw the woman riding on the wolf
Alf was the name of a king the son of Hrothmar who had marked out a battleplace with Helgi at Sigarsvoll after a stay of three nights
Then Helgi spake
35
On a wolf there rode
when dusk it was
A woman who fain
would have him follow
Well she knew
that now would fall
Sigrlins son
at Sigarsvoll
There was a great battle and there Helgi got a mortal wound
36
Sigar riding
did Helgi send
To seek out Eylimis
only daughter
Bid her swiftly
ready to be
If her lover
alive she would find
Sigar spake
37
Hither now
has Helgi sent me
With thee Svava
thyself to speak
The hero said
he fain would see thee
Ere life the nobly
born should leave
Svava spake
38
What chanced with Helgi
Hjorvarths son
Hard to me
is harm now come
If the sea smote him
or sword bit him
Ill shall I bring
to all his foes
Sigar spake
39
In the morn he fell
at Frekastein
The king who was noblest
beneath the sun
Alf has the joy
of victory all
Though need therefor
is never his
Helgi spake
40
Hail to thee Svava
thy sorrow rule
Our meeting last
in life is this
Hard the wounds
of the hero bleed
And close to my heart
the sword has come
41
I bid thee Svava
weep not bride
If thou wilt hearken
to these my words
The bed for Hethin
have thou ready
And yield thy love
to the hero young
Svava spake
42
A vow I had
in my dearloved home
When Helgi sought
with rings to have me
That not of my will
if the warrior died
Would I fold in my arms
a man unfamed
Hethin spake
43
Kiss me Svava
I come not back
Rogheim to see
or Rothulsfjoll
Till vengeance I have
for the son of Hjorvarth
The king who was noblest
beneath the sun
Of Helgi and Svava it is said that they were born again
