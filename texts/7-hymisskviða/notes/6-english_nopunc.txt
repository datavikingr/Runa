Of old the gods 
made feast together
And drink they sought 
ere sated they were
Twigs they shook 
and blood they tried
Rich fare in Ægirs 
hall they found 
2
The mountaindweller 
sat merry as boyhood
But soon like a blinded 
man he seemed
The son of Ygg 
gazed in his eyes
For the gods a feast 
shalt thou forthwith get 
3
The wordwielder toil 
for the giant worked
And so revenge 
on the gods he sought
He bade Sifs mate 
the kettle bring
Therein for ye all 
much ale shall I brew 
4
The farfamed ones 
could find it not
And the holy gods 
could get it nowhere
Till in truthful wise 
did Tyr speak forth
And helpful counsel 
to Hlorrithi gave 
5
There dwells to the east 
of Elivagar
Hymir the wise 
at the end of heaven
A kettle my father 
fierce doth own
A mighty vessel 
a mile in depth 
Thor spake
6
May we win dost thou think 
this whirler of water
Tyr spake
Aye friend we can 
if cunning we are 
7
Forward that day 
with speed they fared
From Asgarth came they 
to Egils home
The goats with horns 
bedecked he guarded
Then they sped to the hall 
where Hymir dwelt 
8
The youth found his grandam 
that greatly he loathed
And full nine hundred 
heads she had
But the other fair 
with gold came forth
And the brightbrowed one 
brought beer to her son 
9
Kinsman of giants 
beneath the kettle
Will I set ye both 
ye heroes bold
For many a time 
my dearloved mate
To guests is wrathful 
and grim of mind 
10
Late to his home 
the misshapen Hymir
The giant harsh 
from his hunting came
The icicles rattled 
as in he came
For the fellows chinforest 
frozen was 
11
Hail to thee Hymir 
good thoughts mayst thou have
Here has thy son 
to thine hall now come
For him have we waited 
his way was long
And with him fares 
the foeman of Hroth
The friend of mankind 
and Veur they call him 
12
See where under 
the gable they sit
Behind the beam 
do they hide themselves
The beam at the glance 
of the giant broke
And the mighty pillar 
in pieces fell 
13
Eight fell from the ledge 
and one alone
The hardhammered kettle 
of all was whole
Forth came they then 
and his foes he sought
The giant old 
and held with his eyes 
14
Much sorrow his heart 
foretold when he saw
The giantess foeman 
come forth on the floor
Then of the steers 
did they bring in three
Their flesh to boil 
did the giant bid 
15
By a head was each 
the shorter hewed
And the beasts to the fire 
straight they bore
The husband of Sif 
ere to sleep he went
Alone two oxen 
of Hymirs ate 
16
To the comrade hoary 
of Hrungnir then
Did Hlorrithis meal 
full mighty seem
Next time at eve 
we three must eat
The food we have 
s the huntings spoil 
17
Fain to row on the sea 
was Veur he said
If the giant bold 
would give him bait
Hymir spake
18
Go to the herd 
if thou hast it in mind
Thou slayer of giants 
thy bait to seek 
For there thou soon 
mayst find methinks
Bait from the oxen 
easy to get
19
Swift to the wood 
the hero went
Till before him an ox 
all black he found 
From the beast the slayer 
of giants broke
The fortress high 
of his double horns
Hymir spake
20
Thy works methinks 
are worse by far
Thou steerer of ships 
than when still thou sittest
21
The lord of the goats 
bade the apebegotten
Farther to steer 
the steed of the rollers
But the giant said 
that his will forsooth
Longer to row 
was little enough 
22
Two whales on his hook 
did the mighty Hymir
Soon pull up 
on a single cast
In the stern the kinsman 
of Othin sat
And Veur with cunning 
his cast prepared 
23
The warder of men 
the worms destroyer
Fixed on his hook 
the head of the ox
There gaped at the bait 
the foe of the gods
The girdler of all 
the earth beneath 
24
The venomous serpent 
swiftly up
To the boat did Thor 
the bold one pull
With his hammer the loathly 
hill of the hair
Of the brother of Fenrir 
he smote from above 
25
The monsters roared 
and the rocks resounded
And all the earth 
so old was shaken
Then sank the fish 
in the sea forthwith 
26
Joyless as back 
they rowed was the giant
Speechless did Hymir 
sit at the oars
With the rudder he sought 
a second wind 
Hymir spake
27
The half of our toil 
wilt thou have with me
And now make fast 
our goat of the flood
Or home wilt thou bear 
the whales to the house
Across the gorge 
of the wooded glen 
28
Hlorrithi stood 
and the stem he gripped
And the seahorse with water 
awash he lifted
Oars and bailer 
and all he bore
With the surfswine home 
to the giants house 
29
His might the giant 
again would match
For stubborn he was 
with the strength of Thor
None truly strong 
though stoutly he rowed
Would he call save one 
who could break the cup 
30
Hlorrithi then 
when the cup he held
Struck with the glass 
the pillars of stone
As he sat the posts 
in pieces he shattered
Yet the glass to Hymir 
whole they brought 
31
But the loved one fair 
of the giant found
A counsel true 
and told her thought
Smite the skull of Hymir 
heavy with food
For harder it is 
than ever was glass 
32
The goats mighty ruler 
then rose on his knee
And with all the strength 
of a god he struck
Whole was the fellows 
helmetstem
But shattered the winecup 
rounded was 
Hymir spake
33
Fair is the treasure 
that from me is gone
Since now the cup 
on my knees lies shattered
So spake the giant 
No more can I say
In days to be 
Thou art brewed mine ale 
34
Enough shall it be 
if out ye can bring
Forth from our house 
the kettle here
Tyr then twice 
to move it tried
But before him the kettle 
twice stood fast 
35
The father of Mothi 
the rim seized firm
And before it stood 
on the floor below
Up on his head 
Sifs husband raised it
And about his heels 
the handles clattered 
36
Not long had they fared 
ere backwards looked
The son of Othin 
once more to see
From their caves in the east 
beheld he coming
With Hymir the throng 
of the manyheaded 
37
He stood and cast 
from his back the kettle
And Mjollnir the lover 
of murder he wielded
So all the whales 
of the waste he slew 
38
Not long had they fared 
ere one there lay
Of Hlorrithis goats 
halfdead on the ground
In his leg the polehorse 
there was lame
The deed the evil 
Loki had done 
39
But ye all have heard 
for of them who have
The tales of the gods 
who better can tell
What prize he won 
from the wildernessdweller
Who both his children 
gave him to boot 
40
The mighty one came 
to the council of gods
And the kettle he had 
that Hymirs was
So gladly their ale 
the gods could drink
In Ægirs hall 
at the autumntime
