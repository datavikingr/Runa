Of old ᚦe gods
made fᛠᛥ togeᚦer
And drink ᚦey sought
ere sated ᚦey were
Twigs ᚦey ᛲᛳk
and blᛳd ᚦey tried
Rich fare in ᚫgirs
hall ᚦey found
2
ᚦe mountaindweller
sat merry as boyhᛳd
But sᛳn like a blinded
man he seemed
ᚦe son of Ygg
gazed in his eyes
For ᚦe gods a fᛠᛥ
ᛲalt ᚦou forᚦwiᚦ get
3
ᚦe wordwielder toil
for ᚦe giant worked
And so reveᛝe
on ᚦe gods he sought
He bade Sifs mate
ᚦe kettle briᛝ
ᚦerein for ye all
much ale ᛲall I brew
4
ᚦe farfamed ones
could find it not
And ᚦe holy gods
could get it nowhere
Till in truᚦful wise
did Tyr spᛠk forᚦ
And helpful counsel
to Hlorriᚦi gave
5
ᚦere dwells to ᚦe ᛠᛥ
of Elivagar
Hymir ᚦe wise
at ᚦe end of hᛠven
A kettle my faᚦer
fierce doᚦ own
A mighty vessel
a mile in depᚦ
ᚦor spake
6
May we win doᛥ ᚦou ᚦink
ᚦis whirler of water
Tyr spake
Aye friend we can
if cunniᛝ we are
7
Forward ᚦat day
wiᚦ speed ᚦey fared
From Asgarᚦ came ᚦey
to Egils home
ᚦe goats wiᚦ horns
bedecked he guarded
ᚦen ᚦey sped to ᚦe hall
where Hymir dwelt
8
ᚦe youᚦ found his grandam
ᚦat grᛠtly he loaᚦed
And full nine hundred
hᛠds ᛲe had
But ᚦe oᚦer fair
wiᚦ gold came forᚦ
And ᚦe brightbrowed one
brought beer to her son
9
Kinsman of giants
benᛠᚦ ᚦe kettle
Will I set ye boᚦ
ye herᛟs bold
For many a time
my dᛠrloved mate
To gueᛥs is wraᚦful
and grim of mind
10
Late to his home
ᚦe misᛲapen Hymir
ᚦe giant harᛲ
from his huntiᛝ came
ᚦe icicles rattled
as in he came
For ᚦe fellows chinforeᛥ
frozen was
11
Hail to ᚦee Hymir
gᛳd ᚦoughts mayᛥ ᚦou have
Here has ᚦy son
to ᚦine hall now come
For him have we waited
his way was loᛝ
And wiᚦ him fares
ᚦe fᛟman of Hroᚦ
ᚦe friend of mankind
and Veur ᚦey call him
12
See where under
ᚦe gable ᚦey sit
Behind ᚦe bᛠm
do ᚦey hide ᚦemselves
ᚦe bᛠm at ᚦe glance
of ᚦe giant broke
And ᚦe mighty pillar
in pieces fell
13
Eight fell from ᚦe ledge
and one alone
ᚦe hardhammered kettle
of all was whole
Forᚦ came ᚦey ᚦen
and his fᛟs he sought
ᚦe giant old
and held wiᚦ his eyes
14
Much sorrow his hᛠrt
foretold when he saw
ᚦe giantess fᛟman
come forᚦ on ᚦe flᛳr
ᚦen of ᚦe ᛥeers
did ᚦey briᛝ in ᚦree
ᚦeir fleᛲ to boil
did ᚦe giant bid
15
By a hᛠd was ᛠch
ᚦe ᛲorter hewed
And ᚦe bᛠᛥs to ᚦe fire
ᛥraight ᚦey bore
ᚦe husband of Sif
ere to sleep he went
Alone two oxen
of Hymirs ate
16
To ᚦe comrade hoary
of Hruᛝnir ᚦen
Did Hlorriᚦis mᛠl
full mighty seem
Next time at eve
we ᚦree muᛥ ᛠt
ᚦe fᛳd we have
s ᚦe huntiᛝs spoil
17
Fain to row on ᚦe sᛠ
was Veur he said
If ᚦe giant bold
would give him bait
Hymir spake
18
Go to ᚦe herd
if ᚦou haᛥ it in mind
ᚦou slayer of giants
ᚦy bait to seek
For ᚦere ᚦou sᛳn
mayᛥ find meᚦinks
Bait from ᚦe oxen
ᛠsy to get
19
Swift to ᚦe wᛳd
ᚦe hero went
Till before him an ox
all black he found
From ᚦe bᛠᛥ ᚦe slayer
of giants broke
ᚦe fortress high
of his double horns
Hymir spake
20
ᚦy works meᚦinks
are worse by far
ᚦou ᛥeerer of ᛲips
ᚦan when ᛥill ᚦou sitteᛥ
21
ᚦe lord of ᚦe goats
bade ᚦe apebegotten
Farᚦer to ᛥeer
ᚦe ᛥeed of ᚦe rollers
But ᚦe giant said
ᚦat his will forsᛳᚦ
Loᛝer to row
was little enough
22
Two whales on his hᛳk
did ᚦe mighty Hymir
Sᛳn pull up
on a siᛝle caᛥ
In ᚦe ᛥern ᚦe kinsman
of Oᚦin sat
And Veur wiᚦ cunniᛝ
his caᛥ prepared
23
ᚦe warder of men
ᚦe worms deᛥroyer
Fixed on his hᛳk
ᚦe hᛠd of ᚦe ox
ᚦere gaped at ᚦe bait
ᚦe fᛟ of ᚦe gods
ᚦe girdler of all
ᚦe ᛠrᚦ benᛠᚦ
24
ᚦe venomous serpent
swiftly up
To ᚦe boat did ᚦor
ᚦe bold one pull
Wiᚦ his hammer ᚦe loaᚦly
hill of ᚦe hair
Of ᚦe broᚦer of Fenrir
he smote from above
25
ᚦe monᛥers roared
and ᚦe rocks resounded
And all ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
so old was ᛲaken
ᚦen sank ᚦe fiᛲ
in ᚦe sᛠ forᚦwiᚦ
26
Joyless as back
ᚦey rowed was ᚦe giant
Speechless did Hymir
sit at ᚦe oars
Wiᚦ ᚦe rudder he sought
a second wind
Hymir spake
27
ᚦe half of our toil
wilt ᚦou have wiᚦ me
And now make faᛥ
our goat of ᚦe flᛳd
Or home wilt ᚦou bᛠr
ᚦe whales to ᚦe house
Across ᚦe gorge
of ᚦe wᛳded glen
28
Hlorriᚦi ᛥᛳd
and ᚦe ᛥem he gripped
And ᚦe sᛠhorse wiᚦ water
awaᛲ he lifted
Oars and bailer
and all he bore
Wiᚦ ᚦe surfswine home
to ᚦe giants house
29
His might ᚦe giant
again would match
For ᛥubborn he was
wiᚦ ᚦe ᛥreᛝᚦ of ᚦor
None truly ᛥroᛝ
ᚦough ᛥoutly he rowed
Would he call save one
who could brᛠk ᚦe cup
30
Hlorriᚦi ᚦen
when ᚦe cup he held
ᛥruck wiᚦ ᚦe glass
ᚦe pillars of ᛥone
As he sat ᚦe poᛥs
in pieces he ᛲattered
Yet ᚦe glass to Hymir
whole ᚦey brought
31
But ᚦe loved one fair
of ᚦe giant found
A counsel true
and told her ᚦought
Smite ᚦe skull of Hymir
hᛠvy wiᚦ fᛳd
For harder it is
ᚦan ever was glass
32
ᚦe goats mighty ruler
ᚦen rose on his knee
And wiᚦ all ᚦe ᛥreᛝᚦ
of a god he ᛥruck
Whole was ᚦe fellows
helmetᛥem
But ᛲattered ᚦe winecup
rounded was
Hymir spake
33
Fair is ᚦe trᛠsure
ᚦat from me is gone
Since now ᚦe cup
on my knees lies ᛲattered
So spake ᚦe giant
No more can I say
In days to be
ᚦou art brewed mine ale
34
Enough ᛲall it be
if out ye can briᛝ
Forᚦ from our house
ᚦe kettle here
Tyr ᚦen twice
to move it tried
But before him ᚦe kettle
twice ᛥᛳd faᛥ
35
ᚦe faᚦer of Moᚦi
ᚦe rim seized firm
And before it ᛥᛳd
on ᚦe flᛳr below
Up on his hᛠd
Sifs husband raised it
And about his heels
ᚦe handles clattered
36
Not loᛝ had ᚦey fared
ere backwards lᛳked
ᚦe son of Oᚦin
once more to see
From ᚦeir caves in ᚦe ᛠᛥ
beheld he comiᛝ
Wiᚦ Hymir ᚦe ᚦroᛝ
of ᚦe manyhᛠded
37
He ᛥᛳd and caᛥ
from his back ᚦe kettle
And Mjollnir ᚦe lover
of murder he wielded
So all ᚦe whales
of ᚦe waᛥe he slew
38
Not loᛝ had ᚦey fared
ere one ᚦere lay
Of Hlorriᚦis goats
halfdᛠd on ᚦe ground
In his leg ᚦe polehorse
ᚦere was lame
ᚦe deed ᚦe evil
Loki had done
39
But ye all have hᛠrd
for of ᚦem who have
ᚦe tales of ᚦe gods
who better can tell
What prize he won
from ᚦe wildernessdweller
Who boᚦ his children
gave him to bᛳt
40
ᚦe mighty one came
to ᚦe council of gods
And ᚦe kettle he had
ᚦat Hymirs was
So gladly ᚦeir ale
ᚦe gods could drink
In ᚫgirs hall
at ᚦe autumntime
