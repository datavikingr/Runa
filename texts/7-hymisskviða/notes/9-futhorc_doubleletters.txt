And helpful counsel

Late to his home

For ᚦe felows chinforeᛥ

1
Hail to ᚦe Hymir

And ᚦe mighty pilar

Eight fel from ᚦe ledge
and one alone

Forᚦ came ᚦey ᚦen
and his fᛟs he sought

and held wiᚦ his eyes
14
Much sorow his hᛠrt
foretold when he saw
ᚦe giantes fᛟman

And ᚦe bᛠᛥs to ᚦe fire
ᛥraight ᚦey bore
ᚦe husband of Sif
ere to slep he went
Alone two oxen
of Hymirs ate
16
To ᚦe comrade hoary

Next time at eve

Fain to row on ᚦe sᛠ

If ᚦe giant bold
would give him bait
Hymir spake
18
Go to ᚦe herd

For ᚦere ᚦou sᛳn

Bait from ᚦe oxen

19
Swift to ᚦe wᛳd
ᚦe hero went
Til before him an ox

From ᚦe bᛠᛥ ᚦe slayer

of his double horns
Hymir spake
20
ᚦy works meᚦinks

21
ᚦe lord of ᚦe goats
bade ᚦe apebegoten
Farᚦer to ᛥer

But ᚦe giant said
ᚦat his wil forsᛳᚦ
Loᛝer to row
was litle enough
2
Two whales on his hᛳk
did ᚦe mighty Hymir
Sᛳn pul up
on a siᛝle caᛥ
In ᚦe ᛥern ᚦe kinsman
of Oᚦin sat
And Veur wiᚦ cuniᛝ

23
ᚦe warder of men
ᚦe worms deᛥroyer
Fixed on his hᛳk

To ᚦe boat did ᚦor

Wiᚦ his hamer ᚦe loaᚦly
hil of ᚦe hair
Of ᚦe broᚦer of Fenrir
he smote from above
25
ᚦe monᛥers roared
and ᚦe rocks resounded
And al ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
so old was ᛲaken
ᚦen sank ᚦe fiᛲ
in ᚦe sᛠ forᚦwiᚦ
26
Joyles as back
ᚦey rowed was ᚦe giant
Spechles did Hymir
sit at ᚦe oars
Wiᚦ ᚦe ruder he sought
a second wind
Hymir spake
27
ᚦe half of our toil

And now make faᛥ
our goat of ᚦe flᛳd
Or home wilt ᚦou bᛠr
ᚦe whales to ᚦe house
Acros ᚦe gorge

28
Hloriᚦi ᛥᛳd

And ᚦe sᛠhorse wiᚦ water
awaᛲ he lifted
Oars and bailer
and al he bore
Wiᚦ ᚦe surfswine home
to ᚦe giants house
29
His might ᚦe giant
again would match
For ᛥuborn he was
wiᚦ ᚦe ᛥreᛝᚦ of ᚦor
None truly ᛥroᛝ
ᚦough ᛥoutly he rowed
Would he cal save one
who could brᛠk ᚦe cup
30
Hloriᚦi ᚦen
when ᚦe cup he held
ᛥruck wiᚦ ᚦe glas
ᚦe pilars of ᛥone
As he sat ᚦe poᛥs
in pieces he ᛲatered
Yet ᚦe glas to Hymir
whole ᚦey brought
31
But ᚦe loved one fair
of ᚦe giant found
A counsel true
and told her ᚦought
Smite ᚦe skul of Hymir
hᛠvy wiᚦ fᛳd
For harder it is
ᚦan ever was glas
32
ᚦe goats mighty ruler

And wiᚦ al ᚦe ᛥreᛝᚦ

Whole was ᚦe felows

But ᛲatered ᚦe winecup

Hymir spake
3
Fair is ᚦe trᛠsure
ᚦat from me is gone
Since now ᚦe cup
on my knes lies ᛲatered
So spake ᚦe giant
No more can I say
In days to be
ᚦou art brewed mine ale
34
Enough ᛲal it be
if out ye can briᛝ
Forᚦ from our house
ᚦe ketle here
Tyr ᚦen twice
to move it tried
But before him ᚦe ketle
twice ᛥᛳd faᛥ
35
ᚦe faᚦer of Moᚦi
ᚦe rim seized firm
And before it ᛥᛳd
on ᚦe flᛳr below
Up on his hᛠd
Sifs husband raised it
And about his hels
ᚦe handles clatered
36
Not loᛝ had ᚦey fared
ere backwards lᛳked
ᚦe son of Oᚦin

From ᚦeir caves in ᚦe ᛠᛥ

Wiᚦ Hymir ᚦe ᚦroᛝ
of ᚦe manyhᛠded
37
He ᛥᛳd and caᛥ
from his back ᚦe ketle
And Mjolnir ᚦe lover
of murder he wielded
So al ᚦe whales
of ᚦe waᛥe he slew
38
Not loᛝ had ᚦey fared
ere one ᚦere lay
Of Hloriᚦis goats
halfdᛠd on ᚦe ground
In his leg ᚦe polehorse
ᚦere was lame
ᚦe ded ᚦe evil

39
But ye al have hᛠrd
for of ᚦem who have
ᚦe tales of ᚦe gods
who beter can tel
What prize he won
from ᚦe wildernesdweler
Who boᚦ his children
gave him to bᛳt
40
ᚦe mighty one came
to ᚦe council of gods
And ᚦe ketle he had
ᚦat Hymirs was
So gladly ᚦeir ale
ᚦe gods could drink
In ᚫgirs hal
at ᚦe autumntime
