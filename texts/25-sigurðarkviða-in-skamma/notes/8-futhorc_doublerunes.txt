Of old did Sigurᚦ
Gjuki seek
ᚦe Volsuᛝ youᛝ
in battles victor
Well he truᛥed
ᚦe broᚦers twain
Wiᚦ mighty oaᚦs
amoᛝ ᚦem sworn

2
A maid ᚦey gave him
and jewels many
Guᚦrun ᚦe youᛝ
ᚦe daughter of Gjuki
ᚦey drank and spake
full many a day
Sigurᚦ ᚦe youᛝ
and Gjukis sons

3
ᚦerᛠfter went ᚦey
Brynhild to wᛳ
And so wiᚦ ᚦem
did Sigurᚦ ride
ᚦe Volsuᛝ youᛝ
in battle valiant
Himself would have had her
if all he had seen

4
ᚦe souᚦern hero
his naked sword
Fairflaᛲiᛝ let
between ᚦem lie
Nor would he come
ᚦe maid to kiss
ᚦe Hunniᛲ kiᛝ
in his arms neer held
ᚦe maiden he gave
to Gjukis sons

5
Ill ᛲe had known not
in all her life
And nought of ᚦe sorrows
of men ᛲe knew
Blame ᛲe had not
nor drᛠmed ᛲe ᛲould bᛠr it
But cruel ᚦe fates
ᚦat amoᛝ ᚦem came

6
By herself at ᚦe end
of day ᛲe sat
And in open words
her hᛠrt ᛲe uttered
I ᛲall Sigurᚦ have
ᚦe hero youᛝ
Een ᚦough wiᚦin
my arms he die

7
ᚦe word I have spoken
sᛳn ᛲall I rue it
His wife is Guᚦrun
and Gunnars am I
Ill Norns set for me
loᛝ desire

8
Oft did ᛲe go
wiᚦ grieviᛝ hᛠrt
On ᚦe glaciers ice
at eventide
When Guᚦrun ᚦen
to her bed was gone
And ᚦe bedcloᚦes Sigurᚦ
about her laid

9
Now Gjukis child
to her lover gᛟs
And ᚦe Hunniᛲ kiᛝ
wiᚦ his wife is happy
Joyless I am
and mateless ever
Till cries from my hᛠvy
hᛠrt burᛥ forᚦ

10
In her wraᚦ to battle
ᛲe roused herself
Gunnar now
ᚦou needs muᛥ lose
Lands of mine
and me myself
No joy ᛲall I have
wiᚦ ᚦe hero ever

11
Back ᛲall I fare
where firᛥ I dwelt
Amoᛝ ᚦe kin
ᚦat come of my race
To wait ᚦere sleepiᛝ
my life away
If Sigurᚦs dᛠᚦ
ᚦou ᛲalt not dare
And beᛥ of herᛟs
ᚦou ᛲalt not be

12
ᚦe son ᛲall fare
wiᚦ his faᚦer hence
And let not loᛝ
ᚦe wolfcub live
Lighter to pay
is ᚦe veᛝᛠnceprice
After ᚦe deed
if ᚦe son is dᛠd

13
Sad was Gunnar
and bowed wiᚦ grief
Deep in ᚦought
ᚦe whole day ᚦrough
Yet from his hᛠrt
it was ever hid
What deed moᛥ fittiᛝ
he ᛲould find
Or what ᚦiᛝ beᛥ
for him ᛲould be
Or if he ᛲould seek
ᚦe Volsuᛝ to slay
For wiᚦ mighty loᛝiᛝ
Sigurᚦ he loved

14
Much he pondered
for many an hour
Never before
was ᚦe wonder known
ᚦat a queen ᛲould ᚦus
her kiᛝdom lᛠve
In counsel ᚦen
did he Hogni call
For him in trueᛥ
truᛥ he held

15
More ᚦan all
to me is Brynhild
Buᚦlis child
ᚦe beᛥ of women
My very life
would I sᛳner lose
ᚦan yield ᚦe love
of yonder maid

16
Wilt ᚦou ᚦe hero
for wᛠlᚦ betray
Twere gᛳd to have
ᚦe gold of ᚦe Rhine
And all ᚦe hoard
in pᛠce to hold
And waitiᛝ fortune
ᚦus to win

17
Few ᚦe words
of Hogni were
Us it beseems not
so to do
To clᛠve wiᚦ swords
ᚦe oaᚦs we swore
ᚦe oaᚦs we swore
and all our vows

18
We know no mightier
men on ᛠrᚦ
ᚦe while we four
ᛟr ᚦe folk hold sway
And while ᚦe Hunniᛲ
hero lives
Nor higher kinᛲip
ᚦe world doᚦ hold

19
If sons we five
ᛲall sᛳn beget
Grᛠt meᚦinks
our race ᛲall grow
Well I see
whence lᛠd ᚦe ways
Tᛳ bitter far
is Brynhilds hate
Gunnar spake

20
Gotᚦorm to wraᚦ
we needs muᛥ rouse
Our youᛝer broᚦer
in raᛲness blind
He entered not
in ᚦe oaᚦs we swore
ᚦe oaᚦs we swore
and all our vows

21
It was ᛠsy to rouse
ᚦe reckless one
ᚦe sword in ᚦe hᛠrt
of Sigurᚦ ᛥᛳd

22
In veᛝᛠnce ᚦe hero
rose in ᚦe hall
And hurled his sword
at ᚦe slayer bold
At Gotᚦorm flew
ᚦe glitteriᛝ ᛥeel
Of Gram full hard
from ᚦe hand of ᚦe kiᛝ

23
ᚦe fᛟman cleft
asunder fell
Forward hands
and hᛠd did sink
And legs and feet
did backward fall

24
Guᚦrun soft
in her bed had slept
Safe from care
at Sigurᚦs side
ᛲe woke to find
her joy had fled
In ᚦe blᛳd of ᚦe friend
of Freyr ᛲe lay

25
So hard ᛲe smote
her hands togeᚦer
ᚦat ᚦe hero rose up
ironhᛠrted
Weep not Guᚦrun
grievous tᛠrs
Bride so youᛝ
for ᚦy broᚦers live

26
Tᛳ youᛝ meᚦinks
is my son as yet
He cannot flee
from ᚦe home of his fᛟs
Fᛠrful and dᛠdly
ᚦe plan ᚦey found
ᚦe counsel new
ᚦat now ᚦey have heeded

27
No son will ride
ᚦough seven ᚦou haᛥ
To ᚦe ᚦiᛝ as ᚦe son
of ᚦeir siᛥer rides
Well I see
who ᚦe ill has worked
On Brynhild alone
lies ᚦe blame for all

28
Above all men
ᚦe maiden loved me
Yet false to Gunnar
I neer was found
I kept ᚦe oaᚦs
and ᚦe kinᛲip I swore
Of his queen ᚦe lover
none may call me

29
In a swᛳn ᛲe sank
when Sigurᚦ died
So hard ᛲe smote
her hands togeᚦer
ᚦat all ᚦe cups
in ᚦe cupboard raᛝ
And loud in ᚦe courtyard
cried ᚦe geese

30
ᚦen Brynhild daughter
of Buᚦli laughed
Only once
wiᚦ all her hᛠrt
When as ᛲe lay
full loud ᛲe hᛠrd
ᚦe grievous wail
of Gjukis daughter

31
ᚦen Gunnar monarch
of men spake forᚦ
ᚦou doᛥ not laugh
ᚦou lover of hate
In gladness ᚦere
or for aught of gᛳd
Why has ᚦy face
so white a hue
Moᚦer of ill
Foredᛳmed ᚦou art

32
A worᚦier woman
wouldᛥ ᚦou have been
If before ᚦine eyes
we had Atli slain
If ᚦy broᚦers bleediᛝ
body hadᛥ seen
And ᚦe blᛳdy wounds
ᚦat ᚦou ᛲouldᛥ bind
Brynhild spake

33
None mock ᚦee Gunnar
ᚦou haᛥ mightily fought
But ᚦy hatred little
doᚦ Atli heed
Loᛝer ᚦan ᚦou
meᚦinks ᛲall he live
And grᛠter in might
ᛲall he ever remain

34
To ᚦee I say
and ᚦyself ᚦou knoweᛥ
ᚦat all ᚦese ills
ᚦou didᛥ ᛠrly ᛲape
No bonds I knew
nor sorrow bore
And wᛠlᚦ I had
in my broᚦers home

35
Never a husband
sought I to have
Before ᚦe Gjukuᛝs
fared to our land
ᚦree were ᚦe kiᛝs
on ᛥeeds ᚦat came
Need of ᚦeir journey
never ᚦere was

36
To ᚦe hero grᛠt
my troᚦ I gave
Who golddecked sat
on Granis back
Not like to ᚦine
was ᚦe light of his eyes
Nor like in form
and face are ye
ᚦough kiᛝly boᚦ
ye seemed to be

37
And so to me
did Atli say
ᚦat ᛲare in our wᛠlᚦ
I ᛲould not have
Of gold or lands
if my hand I gave not
More evil yet
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ I ᛲould yield
ᚦe gold ᚦat he
in my childhᛳd gave me
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ from him
in my youᚦ I had

38
Oft in my mind
I pondered much
If ᛥill I ᛲould fight
and warriors fell
Brave in my byrnie
my broᚦer defyiᛝ
ᚦat would wide
in ᚦe world be known
And sorrow for many
a man would make

39
But ᚦe bond at laᛥ
I let be made
For more ᚦe hoard
I loᛝed to have
ᚦe riᛝs ᚦat ᚦe son
of Sigmund won
No oᚦers trᛠsure
eer I sought

40
Onᛠlone
of all I loved
Nor chaᛝiᛝ hᛠrt
I ever had
All in ᚦe end
ᛲall Atli know
When he hᛠrs I have gone
on ᚦe dᛠᚦroad hence

41 Never a wife
of fickle will
Yet to anoᚦer
man ᛲould yield
So veᛝence for all
my ills ᛲall come

42
Up rose Gunnar
ᚦe peoples ruler
And fluᛝ his arms
round her neck so fair
And all who came
of every kind
Sought to hold her
wiᚦ all ᚦeir hᛠrts

43
But back ᛲe caᛥ
all ᚦose who came
Nor from ᚦe loᛝ road
let ᚦem hold her
In counsel ᚦen
did he Hogni call
Of wisdom now
full grᛠt is our need

44
Let ᚦe warriors here
in ᚦe hall come forᚦ
ᚦine and mine
for ᚦe need is mighty
If haply ᚦe queen
from dᛠᚦ ᚦey may hold
Till her fᛠrful ᚦoughts
wiᚦ time ᛲall fade

45
Few ᚦe words
of Hogni were
From ᚦe loᛝ road now
ᛲall ye hold her not
ᚦat born again
ᛲe may never be
Foul ᛲe came
from her moᚦer forᚦ
And born ᛲe was
for wicked deeds
Sorrow to many
a man to briᛝ

46
From ᚦe spᛠker glᛳmily
Gunnar turned
For ᚦe jewelbᛠrer
her gems was dividiᛝ
On all her wᛠlᚦ
her eyes were gaziᛝ
On ᚦe bondwomen slain
and ᚦe slaughtered slaves

47
Her byrnie of gold
ᛲe donned and grim
Was her hᛠrt ere ᚦe point
of her sword had pierced it
On ᚦe pillow at laᛥ
her hᛠd ᛲe laid
And wounded her plan
ᛲe pondered ᛟr

48
Hiᚦer I will
ᚦat my women come
Who gold are fain
from me to get
Necklaces faᛲioned
fair to ᛠch
ᛲall I give and cloᚦ
and garments bright

49
Silent were all
as so ᛲe spake
And all togeᚦer
answer made
Slain are enough
we seek to live
Not ᚦus ᚦy women
ᛲall honor win

50
Loᛝ ᚦe woman
linendecked pondered
Youᛝ ᛲe was
and weighed her words
For my sake now
ᛲall none unwilliᛝ
Or loaᚦ to die
her life lay down

51
But little of gems
to glᛠm on your limbs
Ye ᚦen ᛲall find
when forᚦ ye fare
To follow me
or of Menjas wᛠlᚦ

52
Sit now Gunnar
for I ᛲall spᛠk
Of ᚦy bride so fair
and so fain to die
ᚦy ᛲip in harbor
home ᚦou haᛥ not
Alᚦough my life
I now have loᛥ

53
ᚦou ᛲalt Guᚦrun requite
more quick ᚦan ᚦou ᚦinkeᛥ
ᚦough sadly mourns
ᚦe maiden wise
Who dwells wiᚦ ᚦe kiᛝ
ᛟr her husband dᛠd

54
A maid ᛲall ᚦen
ᚦe moᚦer bᛠr
Brighter far
ᚦan ᚦe faireᛥ day
Svanhild ᛲall be
or ᚦe bᛠms of ᚦe sun

55
Guᚦrun a noble
husband ᚦou giveᛥ
Yet to many a warrior
wᛟ will ᛲe briᛝ
Not happily wedded
ᛲe holds herself
Her ᛲall Atli
hiᚦer seek
Buᚦlis son
and broᚦer of mine

56
Well I remember
how me ye trᛠted
When ye betrayed me
wiᚦ trᛠcherous wiles
Loᛥ was my joy
as loᛝ as I lived

57
Oddrun as wife
ᚦou fain wouldᛥ win
But Atli ᚦis
from ᚦee wiᚦholds
Yet in secret tryᛥ
ye twain ᛲall love
ᛲe ᛲall hold ᚦee dᛠr
as I had done
If kindly fate
to us had fallen

58
Ill to ᚦee
ᛲall Atli briᛝ
When he caᛥs ᚦee down
in ᚦe den of snakes

59
But sᛳn ᚦerᛠfter
Atli tᛳ
His life meᚦinks
as ᚦou ᛲalt lose
His fortune lose
and ᚦe lives of his sons
Him ᛲall Guᚦrun
grim of hᛠrt
Wiᚦ ᚦe bitiᛝ blade
in his bed deᛥroy

60
It would better beseem
ᚦy siᛥer fair
To follow her husband
firᛥ in dᛠᚦ
If counsel gᛳd
to her were given
Or a hᛠrt akin
to mine ᛲe had

61
Slowly I spᛠk
but for my sake
Her life meᚦinks
ᛲe ᛲall not lose
ᛲe ᛲall wander over
ᚦe tossiᛝ waves
To where Jonak rules
his faᚦers rᛠlm

62
Sons to him
ᛲe sᛳn ᛲall bᛠr
Heirs ᚦerewiᚦ
of Jonaks wᛠlᚦ
But Svanhild far
away is sent
ᚦe child ᛲe bore
to Sigurᚦ brave

63
Bikkis word
her dᛠᚦ ᛲall be
For drᛠdful ᚦe wraᚦ
of Jormunrek
So slain is all
of Sigurᚦs race
And grᛠter ᚦe wᛟ
of Guᚦrun grows

64
Yet one bᛳn
I beg of ᚦee
ᚦe laᛥ of bᛳns
in my life it is
Let ᚦe pyre be built
so broad in ᚦe field
ᚦat rᛳm for us all
will ample be
For us who slain
wiᚦ Sigurᚦ are

65
Wiᚦ ᛲields and carpets
cover ᚦe pyre
ᛲrouds full fair
and fallen slaves
And besides ᚦe Hunniᛲ
hero burn me

66
Besides ᚦe Hunniᛲ
hero ᚦere
Slaves ᛲall burn
full bravely decked
Two at his hᛠd
and two at his feet
A brace of hounds
and a pair of hawks
For so ᛲall all
be seemly done

67
Let between us
lie once more
ᚦe ᛥeel so keen
as so it lay
When boᚦ wiᚦin
one bed we were
And wedded mates
by men were called

68
ᚦe dᛳr of ᚦe hall
ᛲall ᛥrike not ᚦe heel
Of ᚦe hero fair
wiᚦ flaᛲiᛝ riᛝs
If hence my followiᛝ
gᛟs wiᚦ him
Not mᛠn our fariᛝ
forᚦ ᛲall be

69
Bondwomen five
ᛲall follow him
And eight of my ᚦralls
wellborn are ᚦey
Children wiᚦ me
and mine ᚦey were
As gifts ᚦat Buᚦli
his daughter gave

70
Much have I told ᚦee
and more would say
If fate more space
for speech had given
My voice grows wᛠk
my wounds are swelliᛝ
Truᚦ I have said
and so I die
