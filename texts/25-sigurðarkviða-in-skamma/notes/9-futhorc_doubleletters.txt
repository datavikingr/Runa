Of old did Sigurᚦ
Gjuki sek
ᚦe Volsuᛝ youᛝ
in batles victor
Wel he truᛥed
ᚦe broᚦers twain
Wiᚦ mighty oaᚦs
amoᛝ ᚦem sworn

2
A maid ᚦey gave him
and jewels many
Guᚦrun ᚦe youᛝ
ᚦe daughter of Gjuki
ᚦey drank and spake
ful many a day
Sigurᚦ ᚦe youᛝ
and Gjukis sons

3
ᚦerᛠfter went ᚦey
Brynhild to wᛳ
And so wiᚦ ᚦem
did Sigurᚦ ride
ᚦe Volsuᛝ youᛝ
in batle valiant
Himself would have had her
if al he had sen

4
ᚦe souᚦern hero
his naked sword
Fairflaᛲiᛝ let
betwen ᚦem lie
Nor would he come
ᚦe maid to kis
ᚦe Huniᛲ kiᛝ
in his arms ner held
ᚦe maiden he gave
to Gjukis sons

5
Il ᛲe had known not
in al her life
And nought of ᚦe sorows
of men ᛲe knew
Blame ᛲe had not
nor drᛠmed ᛲe ᛲould bᛠr it
But cruel ᚦe fates
ᚦat amoᛝ ᚦem came

6
By herself at ᚦe end
of day ᛲe sat
And in open words
her hᛠrt ᛲe utered
I ᛲal Sigurᚦ have
ᚦe hero youᛝ
Een ᚦough wiᚦin
my arms he die

7
ᚦe word I have spoken
sᛳn ᛲal I rue it
His wife is Guᚦrun
and Gunars am I
Il Norns set for me
loᛝ desire

8
Oft did ᛲe go
wiᚦ grieviᛝ hᛠrt
On ᚦe glaciers ice
at eventide
When Guᚦrun ᚦen
to her bed was gone
And ᚦe bedcloᚦes Sigurᚦ
about her laid

9
Now Gjukis child
to her lover gᛟs
And ᚦe Huniᛲ kiᛝ
wiᚦ his wife is hapy
Joyles I am
and mateles ever
Til cries from my hᛠvy
hᛠrt burᛥ forᚦ

10
In her wraᚦ to batle
ᛲe roused herself
Gunar now
ᚦou neds muᛥ lose
Lands of mine
and me myself
No joy ᛲal I have
wiᚦ ᚦe hero ever

1
Back ᛲal I fare
where firᛥ I dwelt
Amoᛝ ᚦe kin
ᚦat come of my race
To wait ᚦere slepiᛝ
my life away
If Sigurᚦs dᛠᚦ
ᚦou ᛲalt not dare
And beᛥ of herᛟs
ᚦou ᛲalt not be

12
ᚦe son ᛲal fare
wiᚦ his faᚦer hence
And let not loᛝ
ᚦe wolfcub live
Lighter to pay
is ᚦe veᛝᛠnceprice
After ᚦe ded
if ᚦe son is dᛠd

13
Sad was Gunar
and bowed wiᚦ grief
Dep in ᚦought
ᚦe whole day ᚦrough
Yet from his hᛠrt
it was ever hid
What ded moᛥ fitiᛝ
he ᛲould find
Or what ᚦiᛝ beᛥ
for him ᛲould be
Or if he ᛲould sek
ᚦe Volsuᛝ to slay
For wiᚦ mighty loᛝiᛝ
Sigurᚦ he loved

14
Much he pondered
for many an hour
Never before
was ᚦe wonder known
ᚦat a quen ᛲould ᚦus
her kiᛝdom lᛠve
In counsel ᚦen
did he Hogni cal
For him in trueᛥ
truᛥ he held

15
More ᚦan al
to me is Brynhild
Buᚦlis child
ᚦe beᛥ of women
My very life
would I sᛳner lose
ᚦan yield ᚦe love
of yonder maid

16
Wilt ᚦou ᚦe hero
for wᛠlᚦ betray
Twere gᛳd to have
ᚦe gold of ᚦe Rhine
And al ᚦe hoard
in pᛠce to hold
And waitiᛝ fortune
ᚦus to win

17
Few ᚦe words
of Hogni were
Us it besems not
so to do
To clᛠve wiᚦ swords
ᚦe oaᚦs we swore
ᚦe oaᚦs we swore
and al our vows

18
We know no mightier
men on ᛠrᚦ
ᚦe while we four
ᛟr ᚦe folk hold sway
And while ᚦe Huniᛲ
hero lives
Nor higher kinᛲip
ᚦe world doᚦ hold

19
If sons we five
ᛲal sᛳn beget
Grᛠt meᚦinks
our race ᛲal grow
Wel I se
whence lᛠd ᚦe ways
Tᛳ biter far
is Brynhilds hate
Gunar spake

20
Gotᚦorm to wraᚦ
we neds muᛥ rouse
Our youᛝer broᚦer
in raᛲnes blind
He entered not
in ᚦe oaᚦs we swore
ᚦe oaᚦs we swore
and al our vows

21
It was ᛠsy to rouse
ᚦe reckles one
ᚦe sword in ᚦe hᛠrt
of Sigurᚦ ᛥᛳd

2
In veᛝᛠnce ᚦe hero
rose in ᚦe hal
And hurled his sword
at ᚦe slayer bold
At Gotᚦorm flew
ᚦe gliteriᛝ ᛥel
Of Gram ful hard
from ᚦe hand of ᚦe kiᛝ

23
ᚦe fᛟman cleft
asunder fel
Forward hands
and hᛠd did sink
And legs and fet
did backward fal

24
Guᚦrun soft
in her bed had slept
Safe from care
at Sigurᚦs side
ᛲe woke to find
her joy had fled
In ᚦe blᛳd of ᚦe friend
of Freyr ᛲe lay

25
So hard ᛲe smote
her hands togeᚦer
ᚦat ᚦe hero rose up
ironhᛠrted
Wep not Guᚦrun
grievous tᛠrs
Bride so youᛝ
for ᚦy broᚦers live

26
Tᛳ youᛝ meᚦinks
is my son as yet
He canot fle
from ᚦe home of his fᛟs
Fᛠrful and dᛠdly
ᚦe plan ᚦey found
ᚦe counsel new
ᚦat now ᚦey have heded

27
No son wil ride
ᚦough seven ᚦou haᛥ
To ᚦe ᚦiᛝ as ᚦe son
of ᚦeir siᛥer rides
Wel I se
who ᚦe il has worked
On Brynhild alone
lies ᚦe blame for al

28
Above al men
ᚦe maiden loved me
Yet false to Gunar
I ner was found
I kept ᚦe oaᚦs
and ᚦe kinᛲip I swore
Of his quen ᚦe lover
none may cal me

29
In a swᛳn ᛲe sank
when Sigurᚦ died
So hard ᛲe smote
her hands togeᚦer
ᚦat al ᚦe cups
in ᚦe cupboard raᛝ
And loud in ᚦe courtyard
cried ᚦe gese

30
ᚦen Brynhild daughter
of Buᚦli laughed
Only once
wiᚦ al her hᛠrt
When as ᛲe lay
ful loud ᛲe hᛠrd
ᚦe grievous wail
of Gjukis daughter

31
ᚦen Gunar monarch
of men spake forᚦ
ᚦou doᛥ not laugh
ᚦou lover of hate
In gladnes ᚦere
or for aught of gᛳd
Why has ᚦy face
so white a hue
Moᚦer of il
Foredᛳmed ᚦou art

32
A worᚦier woman
wouldᛥ ᚦou have ben
If before ᚦine eyes
we had Atli slain
If ᚦy broᚦers blediᛝ
body hadᛥ sen
And ᚦe blᛳdy wounds
ᚦat ᚦou ᛲouldᛥ bind
Brynhild spake

3
None mock ᚦe Gunar
ᚦou haᛥ mightily fought
But ᚦy hatred litle
doᚦ Atli hed
Loᛝer ᚦan ᚦou
meᚦinks ᛲal he live
And grᛠter in might
ᛲal he ever remain

34
To ᚦe I say
and ᚦyself ᚦou knoweᛥ
ᚦat al ᚦese ils
ᚦou didᛥ ᛠrly ᛲape
No bonds I knew
nor sorow bore
And wᛠlᚦ I had
in my broᚦers home

35
Never a husband
sought I to have
Before ᚦe Gjukuᛝs
fared to our land
ᚦre were ᚦe kiᛝs
on ᛥeds ᚦat came
Ned of ᚦeir journey
never ᚦere was

36
To ᚦe hero grᛠt
my troᚦ I gave
Who goldecked sat
on Granis back
Not like to ᚦine
was ᚦe light of his eyes
Nor like in form
and face are ye
ᚦough kiᛝly boᚦ
ye semed to be

37
And so to me
did Atli say
ᚦat ᛲare in our wᛠlᚦ
I ᛲould not have
Of gold or lands
if my hand I gave not
More evil yet
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ I ᛲould yield
ᚦe gold ᚦat he
in my childhᛳd gave me
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ from him
in my youᚦ I had

38
Oft in my mind
I pondered much
If ᛥil I ᛲould fight
and wariors fel
Brave in my byrnie
my broᚦer defyiᛝ
ᚦat would wide
in ᚦe world be known
And sorow for many
a man would make

39
But ᚦe bond at laᛥ
I let be made
For more ᚦe hoard
I loᛝed to have
ᚦe riᛝs ᚦat ᚦe son
of Sigmund won
No oᚦers trᛠsure
er I sought

40
Onᛠlone
of al I loved
Nor chaᛝiᛝ hᛠrt
I ever had
Al in ᚦe end
ᛲal Atli know
When he hᛠrs I have gone
on ᚦe dᛠᚦroad hence

41 Never a wife
of fickle wil
Yet to anoᚦer
man ᛲould yield
So veᛝence for al
my ils ᛲal come

42
Up rose Gunar
ᚦe peoples ruler
And fluᛝ his arms
round her neck so fair
And al who came
of every kind
Sought to hold her
wiᚦ al ᚦeir hᛠrts

43
But back ᛲe caᛥ
al ᚦose who came
Nor from ᚦe loᛝ road
let ᚦem hold her
In counsel ᚦen
did he Hogni cal
Of wisdom now
ful grᛠt is our ned

4
Let ᚦe wariors here
in ᚦe hal come forᚦ
ᚦine and mine
for ᚦe ned is mighty
If haply ᚦe quen
from dᛠᚦ ᚦey may hold
Til her fᛠrful ᚦoughts
wiᚦ time ᛲal fade

45
Few ᚦe words
of Hogni were
From ᚦe loᛝ road now
ᛲal ye hold her not
ᚦat born again
ᛲe may never be
Foul ᛲe came
from her moᚦer forᚦ
And born ᛲe was
for wicked deds
Sorow to many
a man to briᛝ

46
From ᚦe spᛠker glᛳmily
Gunar turned
For ᚦe jewelbᛠrer
her gems was dividiᛝ
On al her wᛠlᚦ
her eyes were gaziᛝ
On ᚦe bondwomen slain
and ᚦe slaughtered slaves

47
Her byrnie of gold
ᛲe doned and grim
Was her hᛠrt ere ᚦe point
of her sword had pierced it
On ᚦe pilow at laᛥ
her hᛠd ᛲe laid
And wounded her plan
ᛲe pondered ᛟr

48
Hiᚦer I wil
ᚦat my women come
Who gold are fain
from me to get
Necklaces faᛲioned
fair to ᛠch
ᛲal I give and cloᚦ
and garments bright

49
Silent were al
as so ᛲe spake
And al togeᚦer
answer made
Slain are enough
we sek to live
Not ᚦus ᚦy women
ᛲal honor win

50
Loᛝ ᚦe woman
linendecked pondered
Youᛝ ᛲe was
and weighed her words
For my sake now
ᛲal none unwiliᛝ
Or loaᚦ to die
her life lay down

51
But litle of gems
to glᛠm on your limbs
Ye ᚦen ᛲal find
when forᚦ ye fare
To folow me
or of Menjas wᛠlᚦ

52
Sit now Gunar
for I ᛲal spᛠk
Of ᚦy bride so fair
and so fain to die
ᚦy ᛲip in harbor
home ᚦou haᛥ not
Alᚦough my life
I now have loᛥ

53
ᚦou ᛲalt Guᚦrun requite
more quick ᚦan ᚦou ᚦinkeᛥ
ᚦough sadly mourns
ᚦe maiden wise
Who dwels wiᚦ ᚦe kiᛝ
ᛟr her husband dᛠd

54
A maid ᛲal ᚦen
ᚦe moᚦer bᛠr
Brighter far
ᚦan ᚦe faireᛥ day
Svanhild ᛲal be
or ᚦe bᛠms of ᚦe sun

5
Guᚦrun a noble
husband ᚦou giveᛥ
Yet to many a warior
wᛟ wil ᛲe briᛝ
Not hapily weded
ᛲe holds herself
Her ᛲal Atli
hiᚦer sek
Buᚦlis son
and broᚦer of mine

56
Wel I remember
how me ye trᛠted
When ye betrayed me
wiᚦ trᛠcherous wiles
Loᛥ was my joy
as loᛝ as I lived

57
Odrun as wife
ᚦou fain wouldᛥ win
But Atli ᚦis
from ᚦe wiᚦholds
Yet in secret tryᛥ
ye twain ᛲal love
ᛲe ᛲal hold ᚦe dᛠr
as I had done
If kindly fate
to us had falen

58
Il to ᚦe
ᛲal Atli briᛝ
When he caᛥs ᚦe down
in ᚦe den of snakes

59
But sᛳn ᚦerᛠfter
Atli tᛳ
His life meᚦinks
as ᚦou ᛲalt lose
His fortune lose
and ᚦe lives of his sons
Him ᛲal Guᚦrun
grim of hᛠrt
Wiᚦ ᚦe bitiᛝ blade
in his bed deᛥroy

60
It would beter besem
ᚦy siᛥer fair
To folow her husband
firᛥ in dᛠᚦ
If counsel gᛳd
to her were given
Or a hᛠrt akin
to mine ᛲe had

61
Slowly I spᛠk
but for my sake
Her life meᚦinks
ᛲe ᛲal not lose
ᛲe ᛲal wander over
ᚦe tosiᛝ waves
To where Jonak rules
his faᚦers rᛠlm

62
Sons to him
ᛲe sᛳn ᛲal bᛠr
Heirs ᚦerewiᚦ
of Jonaks wᛠlᚦ
But Svanhild far
away is sent
ᚦe child ᛲe bore
to Sigurᚦ brave

63
Bikis word
her dᛠᚦ ᛲal be
For drᛠdful ᚦe wraᚦ
of Jormunrek
So slain is al
of Sigurᚦs race
And grᛠter ᚦe wᛟ
of Guᚦrun grows

64
Yet one bᛳn
I beg of ᚦe
ᚦe laᛥ of bᛳns
in my life it is
Let ᚦe pyre be built
so broad in ᚦe field
ᚦat rᛳm for us al
wil ample be
For us who slain
wiᚦ Sigurᚦ are

65
Wiᚦ ᛲields and carpets
cover ᚦe pyre
ᛲrouds ful fair
and falen slaves
And besides ᚦe Huniᛲ
hero burn me

6
Besides ᚦe Huniᛲ
hero ᚦere
Slaves ᛲal burn
ful bravely decked
Two at his hᛠd
and two at his fet
A brace of hounds
and a pair of hawks
For so ᛲal al
be semly done

67
Let betwen us
lie once more
ᚦe ᛥel so ken
as so it lay
When boᚦ wiᚦin
one bed we were
And weded mates
by men were caled

68
ᚦe dᛳr of ᚦe hal
ᛲal ᛥrike not ᚦe hel
Of ᚦe hero fair
wiᚦ flaᛲiᛝ riᛝs
If hence my folowiᛝ
gᛟs wiᚦ him
Not mᛠn our fariᛝ
forᚦ ᛲal be

69
Bondwomen five
ᛲal folow him
And eight of my ᚦrals
welborn are ᚦey
Children wiᚦ me
and mine ᚦey were
As gifts ᚦat Buᚦli
his daughter gave

70
Much have I told ᚦe
and more would say
If fate more space
for spech had given
My voice grows wᛠk
my wounds are sweliᛝ
Truᚦ I have said
and so I die
