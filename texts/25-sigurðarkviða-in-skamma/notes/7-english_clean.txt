1
Of old did Sigurth
Gjuki seek
The Volsung young
in battles victor
Well he trusted
the brothers twain
With mighty oaths
among them sworn

2
A maid they gave him
and jewels many
Guthrun the young
the daughter of Gjuki
They drank and spake
full many a day
Sigurth the young
and Gjukis sons

3
Thereafter went they
Brynhild to woo
And so with them
did Sigurth ride
The Volsung young
in battle valiant
Himself would have had her
if all he had seen

4
The southern hero
his naked sword
Fairflashing let
between them lie
Nor would he come
the maid to kiss
The Hunnish king
in his arms neer held
The maiden he gave
to Gjukis sons

5
Ill she had known not
in all her life
And nought of the sorrows
of men she knew
Blame she had not
nor dreamed she should bear it
But cruel the fates
that among them came

6
By herself at the end
of day she sat
And in open words
her heart she uttered
I shall Sigurth have
the hero young
Een though within
my arms he die

7
The word I have spoken
soon shall I rue it
His wife is Guthrun
and Gunnars am I
Ill Norns set for me
long desire

8
Oft did she go
with grieving heart
On the glaciers ice
at eventide
When Guthrun then
to her bed was gone
And the bedclothes Sigurth
about her laid

9
Now Gjukis child
to her lover goes
And the Hunnish king
with his wife is happy
Joyless I am
and mateless ever
Till cries from my heavy
heart burst forth

10
In her wrath to battle
she roused herself
Gunnar now
thou needs must lose
Lands of mine
and me myself
No joy shall I have
with the hero ever

11
Back shall I fare
where first I dwelt
Among the kin
that come of my race
To wait there sleeping
my life away
If Sigurths death
thou shalt not dare
And best of heroes
thou shalt not be

12
The son shall fare
with his father hence
And let not long
the wolfcub live
Lighter to pay
is the vengeanceprice
After the deed
if the son is dead

13
Sad was Gunnar
and bowed with grief
Deep in thought
the whole day through
Yet from his heart
it was ever hid
What deed most fitting
he should find
Or what thing best
for him should be
Or if he should seek
the Volsung to slay
For with mighty longing
Sigurth he loved

14
Much he pondered
for many an hour
Never before
was the wonder known
That a queen should thus
her kingdom leave
In counsel then
did he Hogni call
For him in truest
trust he held

15
More than all
to me is Brynhild
Buthlis child
the best of women
My very life
would I sooner lose
Than yield the love
of yonder maid

16
Wilt thou the hero
for wealth betray
Twere good to have
the gold of the Rhine
And all the hoard
in peace to hold
And waiting fortune
thus to win

17
Few the words
of Hogni were
Us it beseems not
so to do
To cleave with swords
the oaths we swore
The oaths we swore
and all our vows

18
We know no mightier
men on earth
The while we four
oer the folk hold sway
And while the Hunnish
hero lives
Nor higher kinship
the world doth hold

19
If sons we five
shall soon beget
Great methinks
our race shall grow
Well I see
whence lead the ways
Too bitter far
is Brynhilds hate
Gunnar spake

20
Gotthorm to wrath
we needs must rouse
Our younger brother
in rashness blind
He entered not
in the oaths we swore
The oaths we swore
and all our vows

21
It was easy to rouse
the reckless one
The sword in the heart
of Sigurth stood

22
In vengeance the hero
rose in the hall
And hurled his sword
at the slayer bold
At Gotthorm flew
the glittering steel
Of Gram full hard
from the hand of the king

23
The foeman cleft
asunder fell
Forward hands
and head did sink
And legs and feet
did backward fall

24
Guthrun soft
in her bed had slept
Safe from care
at Sigurths side
She woke to find
her joy had fled
In the blood of the friend
of Freyr she lay

25
So hard she smote
her hands together
That the hero rose up
ironhearted
Weep not Guthrun
grievous tears
Bride so young
for thy brothers live

26
Too young methinks
is my son as yet
He cannot flee
from the home of his foes
Fearful and deadly
the plan they found
The counsel new
that now they have heeded

27
No son will ride
though seven thou hast
To the Thing as the son
of their sister rides
Well I see
who the ill has worked
On Brynhild alone
lies the blame for all

28
Above all men
the maiden loved me
Yet false to Gunnar
I neer was found
I kept the oaths
and the kinship I swore
Of his queen the lover
none may call me

29
In a swoon she sank
when Sigurth died
So hard she smote
her hands together
That all the cups
in the cupboard rang
And loud in the courtyard
cried the geese

30
Then Brynhild daughter
of Buthli laughed
Only once
with all her heart
When as she lay
full loud she heard
The grievous wail
of Gjukis daughter

31
Then Gunnar monarch
of men spake forth
Thou dost not laugh
thou lover of hate
In gladness there
or for aught of good
Why has thy face
so white a hue
Mother of ill
Foredoomed thou art

32
A worthier woman
wouldst thou have been
If before thine eyes
we had Atli slain
If thy brothers bleeding
body hadst seen
And the bloody wounds
that thou shouldst bind
Brynhild spake

33
None mock thee Gunnar
thou hast mightily fought
But thy hatred little
doth Atli heed
Longer than thou
methinks shall he live
And greater in might
shall he ever remain

34
To thee I say
and thyself thou knowest
That all these ills
thou didst early shape
No bonds I knew
nor sorrow bore
And wealth I had
in my brothers home

35
Never a husband
sought I to have
Before the Gjukungs
fared to our land
Three were the kings
on steeds that came
Need of their journey
never there was

36
To the hero great
my troth I gave
Who golddecked sat
on Granis back
Not like to thine
was the light of his eyes
Nor like in form
and face are ye
Though kingly both
ye seemed to be

37
And so to me
did Atli say
That share in our wealth
I should not have
Of gold or lands
if my hand I gave not
More evil yet
the wealth I should yield
The gold that he
in my childhood gave me
The wealth from him
in my youth I had

38
Oft in my mind
I pondered much
If still I should fight
and warriors fell
Brave in my byrnie
my brother defying
That would wide
in the world be known
And sorrow for many
a man would make

39
But the bond at last
I let be made
For more the hoard
I longed to have
The rings that the son
of Sigmund won
No others treasure
eer I sought

40
Onealone
of all I loved
Nor changing heart
I ever had
All in the end
shall Atli know
When he hears I have gone
on the deathroad hence

41 Never a wife
of fickle will
Yet to another
man should yield
So vengence for all
my ills shall come

42
Up rose Gunnar
the peoples ruler
And flung his arms
round her neck so fair
And all who came
of every kind
Sought to hold her
with all their hearts

43
But back she cast
all those who came
Nor from the long road
let them hold her
In counsel then
did he Hogni call
Of wisdom now
full great is our need

44
Let the warriors here
in the hall come forth
Thine and mine
for the need is mighty
If haply the queen
from death they may hold
Till her fearful thoughts
with time shall fade

45
Few the words
of Hogni were
From the long road now
shall ye hold her not
That born again
she may never be
Foul she came
from her mother forth
And born she was
for wicked deeds
Sorrow to many
a man to bring

46
From the speaker gloomily
Gunnar turned
For the jewelbearer
her gems was dividing
On all her wealth
her eyes were gazing
On the bondwomen slain
and the slaughtered slaves

47
Her byrnie of gold
she donned and grim
Was her heart ere the point
of her sword had pierced it
On the pillow at last
her head she laid
And wounded her plan
she pondered oer

48
Hither I will
that my women come
Who gold are fain
from me to get
Necklaces fashioned
fair to each
Shall I give and cloth
and garments bright

49
Silent were all
as so she spake
And all together
answer made
Slain are enough
we seek to live
Not thus thy women
shall honor win

50
Long the woman
linendecked pondered
Young she was
and weighed her words
For my sake now
shall none unwilling
Or loath to die
her life lay down

51
But little of gems
to gleam on your limbs
Ye then shall find
when forth ye fare
To follow me
or of Menjas wealth

52
Sit now Gunnar
for I shall speak
Of thy bride so fair
and so fain to die
Thy ship in harbor
home thou hast not
Although my life
I now have lost

53
Thou shalt Guthrun requite
more quick than thou thinkest
Though sadly mourns
the maiden wise
Who dwells with the king
oer her husband dead

54
A maid shall then
the mother bear
Brighter far
than the fairest day
Svanhild shall be
or the beams of the sun

55
Guthrun a noble
husband thou givest
Yet to many a warrior
woe will she bring
Not happily wedded
she holds herself
Her shall Atli
hither seek
Buthlis son
and brother of mine

56
Well I remember
how me ye treated
When ye betrayed me
with treacherous wiles
Lost was my joy
as long as I lived

57
Oddrun as wife
thou fain wouldst win
But Atli this
from thee withholds
Yet in secret tryst
ye twain shall love
She shall hold thee dear
as I had done
If kindly fate
to us had fallen

58
Ill to thee
shall Atli bring
When he casts thee down
in the den of snakes

59
But soon thereafter
Atli too
His life methinks
as thou shalt lose
His fortune lose
and the lives of his sons
Him shall Guthrun
grim of heart
With the biting blade
in his bed destroy

60
It would better beseem
thy sister fair
To follow her husband
first in death
If counsel good
to her were given
Or a heart akin
to mine she had

61
Slowly I speak
but for my sake
Her life methinks
she shall not lose
She shall wander over
the tossing waves
To where Jonak rules
his fathers realm

62
Sons to him
she soon shall bear
Heirs therewith
of Jonaks wealth
But Svanhild far
away is sent
The child she bore
to Sigurth brave

63
Bikkis word
her death shall be
For dreadful the wrath
of Jormunrek
So slain is all
of Sigurths race
And greater the woe
of Guthrun grows

64
Yet one boon
I beg of thee
The last of boons
in my life it is
Let the pyre be built
so broad in the field
That room for us all
will ample be
For us who slain
with Sigurth are

65
With shields and carpets
cover the pyre
Shrouds full fair
and fallen slaves
And besides the Hunnish
hero burn me

66
Besides the Hunnish
hero there
Slaves shall burn
full bravely decked
Two at his head
and two at his feet
A brace of hounds
and a pair of hawks
For so shall all
be seemly done

67
Let between us
lie once more
The steel so keen
as so it lay
When both within
one bed we were
And wedded mates
by men were called

68
The door of the hall
shall strike not the heel
Of the hero fair
with flashing rings
If hence my following
goes with him
Not mean our faring
forth shall be

69
Bondwomen five
shall follow him
And eight of my thralls
wellborn are they
Children with me
and mine they were
As gifts that Buthli
his daughter gave

70
Much have I told thee
and more would say
If fate more space
for speech had given
My voice grows weak
my wounds are swelling
Truth I have said
and so I die
