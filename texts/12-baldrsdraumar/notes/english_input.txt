1.
Once were the gods |
together met,
And the goddesses came |
and council held,
And the far-famed ones |
the truth would find,
Why baleful dreams |
to Baldr had come. 
2.
Then Othin rose, |
the enchanter old,
And the saddle he laid |
on Sleipnir's back;
Thence rode he down |
to Niflhel deep,
And the hound he met |
that came from hell. 
3.
Bloody he was |
on his breast before,
At the father of magic |
he howled from afar;
Forward rode Othin, |
the earth resounded
Till the house so high |
of Hel he reached. 
4.
Then Othin rode |
to the eastern door,
There, he knew well, |
was the wise-woman's grave;
Magic he spoke |
and mighty charms,
Till spell-bound she rose, |
and in death she spoke: 
5.
"What is the man, |
to me unknown,
That has made me travel |
the troublous road?
I was snowed on with snow, |
and smitten with rain,
And drenched with dew; |
long was I dead." 
Othin spake:
6.
"Vegtam my name, |
I am Valtam's son;
Speak thou of hell, |
for of heaven I know:
For whom are the benches |
bright with rings,
And the platforms gay |
bedecked with gold?" 
The Wise-Woman spake:
7.
"Here for Baldr |
the mead is brewed,
The shining drink, |
and a shield lies o'er it;
But their hope is gone |
from the mighty gods.
Unwilling I spake, |
and now would be still." 
Othin spake:
8.
"Wise-woman, cease not! |
I seek from thee
All to know |
that I fain would ask:
Who shall the bane |
of Baldr become,
And steal the life |
from Othin's son?" 
The Wise-Woman spake:
9.
"Hoth thither bears |
the far-famed branch,
He shall the bane |
of Baldr become,
And steal the life |
from Othin's son.
Unwilling I spake, |
and now would be still." 
Othin spake:
10.
"Wise-woman, cease not! |
I seek from thee
All to know |
that I fain would ask:
Who shall vengeance win |
for the evil work,
Or bring to the flames |
the slayer of Baldr?" 
The Wise-Woman spake:
11.
"Rind bears Vali |
in Vestrsalir,
And one night old |
fights Othin's son;
His hands he shall wash not, |
his hair he shall comb not,
Till the slayer of Baldr |
he brings to the flames.
Unwilling I spake, |
and now would be still." 
Othin spake:
12.
"Wise-woman, cease not! |
I seek from thee
All to know |
that I fain would ask:
What maidens are they |
who then shall weep,
And toss to the sky |
the yards of the sails?" 
The Wise-Woman spake:
13.
"Vegtam thou art not, |
as erstwhile I thought;
Othin thou art, |
the enchanter old." 
Othin spake:
"No wise-woman art thou, |
nor wisdom hast;
Of giants three |
the mother art thou." 
The Wise-Woman spake:
14.
"Home ride, Othin, |
be ever proud;
For no one of men |
shall seek me more
Till Loki wanders |
loose from his bonds,
And to the last strife |
the destroyers come."
