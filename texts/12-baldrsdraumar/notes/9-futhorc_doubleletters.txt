Once were ᚦe gods

Why baleful drᛠms
to Baldr had come
2

And ᚦe sadle he laid

And ᚦe hound he met

3
Blᛳdy he was
on his brᛠᛥ before
At ᚦe faᚦer of magic

Forward rode Oᚦin

Til ᚦe house so high
of Hel he rᛠched
4
ᚦen Oᚦin rode
to ᚦe ᛠᛥern dᛳr

Til spelbound ᛲe rose
and in dᛠᚦ ᛲe spoke

Here for Baldr
ᚦe mᛠd is brewed
ᚦe ᛲiniᛝ drink
and a ᛲield lies ᛟr it
But ᚦeir hope is gone
from ᚦe mighty gods
