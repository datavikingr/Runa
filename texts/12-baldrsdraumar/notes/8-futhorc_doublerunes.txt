Once were ᚦe gods
togeᚦer met
And ᚦe goddesses came
and council held
And ᚦe farfamed ones
ᚦe truᚦ would find
Why baleful drᛠms
to Baldr had come
2
ᚦen Oᚦin rose
ᚦe enchanter old
And ᚦe saddle he laid
on Sleipnirs back
ᚦence rode he down
to Niflhel deep
And ᚦe hound he met
ᚦat came from hell
3
Blᛳdy he was
on his brᛠᛥ before
At ᚦe faᚦer of magic
he howled from afar
Forward rode Oᚦin
ᚦe ᛠrᚦ resounded
Till ᚦe house so high
of Hel he rᛠched
4
ᚦen Oᚦin rode
to ᚦe ᛠᛥern dᛳr
ᚦere he knew well
was ᚦe wisewomans grave
Magic he spoke
and mighty charms
Till spellbound ᛲe rose
and in dᛠᚦ ᛲe spoke
5
What is ᚦe man
to me unknown
ᚦat has made me travel
ᚦe troublous road
I was snowed on wiᚦ snow
and smitten wiᚦ rain
And drenched wiᚦ dew
loᛝ was I dᛠd
Oᚦin spake
6
Vegtam my name
I am Valtams son
Spᛠk ᚦou of hell
for of hᛠven I know
For whom are ᚦe benches
bright wiᚦ riᛝs
And ᚦe platforms gay
bedecked wiᚦ gold
ᚦe WiseWoman spake
7
Here for Baldr
ᚦe mᛠd is brewed
ᚦe ᛲiniᛝ drink
and a ᛲield lies ᛟr it
But ᚦeir hope is gone
from ᚦe mighty gods
Unwilliᛝ I spake
and now would be ᛥill
Oᚦin spake
8
Wisewoman cᛠse not
I seek from ᚦee
All to know
ᚦat I fain would ask
Who ᛲall ᚦe bane
of Baldr become
And ᛥᛠl ᚦe life
from Oᚦins son
ᚦe WiseWoman spake
9
Hoᚦ ᚦiᚦer bᛠrs
ᚦe farfamed branch
He ᛲall ᚦe bane
of Baldr become
And ᛥᛠl ᚦe life
from Oᚦins son
Unwilliᛝ I spake
and now would be ᛥill
Oᚦin spake
10
Wisewoman cᛠse not
I seek from ᚦee
All to know
ᚦat I fain would ask
Who ᛲall veᛝᛠnce win
for ᚦe evil work
Or briᛝ to ᚦe flames
ᚦe slayer of Baldr
ᚦe WiseWoman spake
11
Rind bᛠrs Vali
in Veᛥrsalir
And one night old
fights Oᚦins son
His hands he ᛲall waᛲ not
his hair he ᛲall comb not
Till ᚦe slayer of Baldr
he briᛝs to ᚦe flames
Unwilliᛝ I spake
and now would be ᛥill
Oᚦin spake
12
Wisewoman cᛠse not
I seek from ᚦee
All to know
ᚦat I fain would ask
What maidens are ᚦey
who ᚦen ᛲall weep
And toss to ᚦe sky
ᚦe yards of ᚦe sails
ᚦe WiseWoman spake
13
Vegtam ᚦou art not
as erᛥwhile I ᚦought
Oᚦin ᚦou art
ᚦe enchanter old
Oᚦin spake
No wisewoman art ᚦou
nor wisdom haᛥ
Of giants ᚦree
ᚦe moᚦer art ᚦou
ᚦe WiseWoman spake
14
Home ride Oᚦin
be ever proud
For no one of men
ᛲall seek me more
Till Loki wanders
lᛳse from his bonds
And to ᚦe laᛥ ᛥrife
ᚦe deᛥroyers come
