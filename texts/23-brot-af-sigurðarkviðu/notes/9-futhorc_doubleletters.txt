ᚦe fire raged
ᚦe ᛠrᚦ was rocked
ᚦe flames lᛠped high
to hᛠven itself
Few were ᚦe hardy
herᛟs would dare
To ride or lᛠp
ᚦe ragiᛝ flames
Sigurᚦ urged Grani
ᚦen wiᚦ his sword
ᚦe fire slackened
before ᚦe hero
ᚦe flames sank low
for ᚦe gredy of fame
ᚦe armor flaᛲed
ᚦat Regin had faᛲioned

Sigurᚦ ᚦe dragon
slew and ᚦat
Wil men recal
while ᚦe world remains
But litle boldnes
ᚦy broᚦer had
To ride or lᛠp
ᚦe ragiᛝ flames

Forᚦ went Sigurᚦ
and spech he sought not
ᚦe friend of herᛟs
his hᛠd bowed down
Such was his grief
ᚦat asunder burᛥ
His mailcoat al
of iron wrought


Hogni spake

1
What evil ded
has Sigurᚦ done
ᚦat ᚦe heros life
ᚦou fain wouldᛥ have
Gunar spake

2
Sigurᚦ oaᚦs
to me haᚦ sworn
Oaᚦs haᚦ sworn
and al haᚦ broken
He betrayed me ᚦere
where trueᛥ al
His oaᚦs meᚦinks
he ought to have kept
Hogni spake

3
ᚦy hᛠrt haᚦ Brynhild
wheted to hate
Evil to work
and harm to win
ᛲe grudges ᚦe honor
ᚦat Guᚦrun has
And ᚦat joy of herself
ᚦou ᛥil doᛥ have

4
ᚦey cᛳked a wolf
ᚦey cut up a snake
ᚦey gave to Gotᚦorm
ᚦe gredy ones fleᛲ
Before ᚦe men
to murder minded
Laid ᚦeir hands
on ᚦe hero bold

5
Slain was Sigurᚦ
souᚦ of ᚦe Rhine
From a limb a raven
caled ful loud
Your blᛳd ᛲal reden
Atlis blade
And your oaᚦs ᛲal bind
you boᚦ in chains

6
Wiᚦout ᛥᛳd Guᚦrun
Gjukis daughter
Hᛠr now ᚦe spech
ᚦat firᛥ ᛲe spake
Where is Sigurᚦ now
ᚦe noble kiᛝ
ᚦat my kinsmen ridiᛝ
before him come

7
Only ᚦis
did Hogni answer
Sigurᚦ we
wiᚦ our swords have slain
ᚦe gray horse mourns
by his maᛥer dᛠd

8
ᚦen Brynhild spake
ᚦe daughter of Buᚦli
Wel ᛲal ye joy
in wᛠpons and lands
Sigurᚦ alone
of al had ben lord
If a litle loᛝer
his life had ben

9
Right were it not
ᚦat so he ᛲould rule
ᛟr Gjukis wᛠlᚦ
and ᚦe race of ᚦe Goᚦs
Five are ᚦe sons
for ruliᛝ ᚦe folk
And gredy of fight
ᚦat he haᚦ faᚦered

10
ᚦen Brynhild laughed
and ᚦe buildiᛝ echᛟd
Only once
wiᚦ al her hᛠrt
Loᛝ ᛲal ye joy
in lands and men
Now ye have slain
ᚦe hero noble

1
ᚦen Guᚦrun spake
ᚦe daughter of Gjuki
Much ᚦou spᛠkeᛥ
in evil spech
Acursed be Gunar
Sigurᚦs kiler
Veᛝᛠnce ᛲal come
for his cruel hᛠrt

12
ᛠrly came eveniᛝ
and ale was drunk
And amoᛝ ᚦem loᛝ
and loud ᚦey talked
ᚦey slumbered al
when ᚦeir beds ᚦey sought
But Gunar alone
was loᛝ awake

13
His fet were tosiᛝ
he talked to himself
And ᚦe slayer of hoᛥs
began to hed
What ᚦe twain from ᚦe tre
had told him ᚦen
ᚦe raven and ᛠgle
as home ᚦey rode

14
Brynhild awoke
ᚦe daughter of Buᚦli
ᚦe wariors daughter
ere dawn of day
Love me or hate me
ᚦe harm is done
And my grief cries out
or else I die

15
Silent were al
who hᛠrd her spᛠk
And nought of ᚦe hᛠrt
of ᚦe quen ᚦey knew
Who wept such tᛠrs
ᚦe ᚦiᛝ to tel
ᚦat laughiᛝ once
of ᚦe men ᛲe had won
Brynhild spake

16
Gunar I drᛠmed
a drᛠm ful grim
In ᚦe hal were corpses
cold was my bed
And ruler ᚦou
didᛥ joyles ride
Wiᚦ feters bound
in ᚦe fᛟmens ᚦroᛝ

17


Uterly now
your Nifluᛝ race
Al ᛲal die
your oaᚦs ye have broken

18
ᚦou haᛥ Gunar
ᚦe ded forgot
When blᛳd in your fᛳtprints
boᚦ ye miᛝled
Al to him
haᛥ repaid wiᚦ il
Who fain had made ᚦe
ᚦe foremoᛥ of kiᛝs

19
Wel did he prove
when proud he rode
To win me ᚦen
ᚦy wife to be
How true ᚦe hoᛥslayer
ever had held
ᚦe oaᚦs he had made
wiᚦ ᚦe monarch youᛝ
