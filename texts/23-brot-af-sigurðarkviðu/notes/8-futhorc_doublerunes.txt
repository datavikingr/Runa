ᚦe fire raged
ᚦe ᛠrᚦ was rocked
ᚦe flames lᛠped high
to hᛠven itself
Few were ᚦe hardy
herᛟs would dare
To ride or lᛠp
ᚦe ragiᛝ flames
Sigurᚦ urged Grani
ᚦen wiᚦ his sword
ᚦe fire slackened
before ᚦe hero
ᚦe flames sank low
for ᚦe greedy of fame
ᚦe armor flaᛲed
ᚦat Regin had faᛲioned

Sigurᚦ ᚦe dragon
slew and ᚦat
Will men recall
while ᚦe world remains
But little boldness
ᚦy broᚦer had
To ride or lᛠp
ᚦe ragiᛝ flames

Forᚦ went Sigurᚦ
and speech he sought not
ᚦe friend of herᛟs
his hᛠd bowed down
Such was his grief
ᚦat asunder burᛥ
His mailcoat all
of iron wrought


Hogni spake

1
What evil deed
has Sigurᚦ done
ᚦat ᚦe heros life
ᚦou fain wouldᛥ have
Gunnar spake

2
Sigurᚦ oaᚦs
to me haᚦ sworn
Oaᚦs haᚦ sworn
and all haᚦ broken
He betrayed me ᚦere
where trueᛥ all
His oaᚦs meᚦinks
he ought to have kept
Hogni spake

3
ᚦy hᛠrt haᚦ Brynhild
whetted to hate
Evil to work
and harm to win
ᛲe grudges ᚦe honor
ᚦat Guᚦrun has
And ᚦat joy of herself
ᚦou ᛥill doᛥ have

4
ᚦey cᛳked a wolf
ᚦey cut up a snake
ᚦey gave to Gotᚦorm
ᚦe greedy ones fleᛲ
Before ᚦe men
to murder minded
Laid ᚦeir hands
on ᚦe hero bold

5
Slain was Sigurᚦ
souᚦ of ᚦe Rhine
From a limb a raven
called full loud
Your blᛳd ᛲall redden
Atlis blade
And your oaᚦs ᛲall bind
you boᚦ in chains

6
Wiᚦout ᛥᛳd Guᚦrun
Gjukis daughter
Hᛠr now ᚦe speech
ᚦat firᛥ ᛲe spake
Where is Sigurᚦ now
ᚦe noble kiᛝ
ᚦat my kinsmen ridiᛝ
before him come

7
Only ᚦis
did Hogni answer
Sigurᚦ we
wiᚦ our swords have slain
ᚦe gray horse mourns
by his maᛥer dᛠd

8
ᚦen Brynhild spake
ᚦe daughter of Buᚦli
Well ᛲall ye joy
in wᛠpons and lands
Sigurᚦ alone
of all had been lord
If a little loᛝer
his life had been

9
Right were it not
ᚦat so he ᛲould rule
ᛟr Gjukis wᛠlᚦ
and ᚦe race of ᚦe Goᚦs
Five are ᚦe sons
for ruliᛝ ᚦe folk
And greedy of fight
ᚦat he haᚦ faᚦered

10
ᚦen Brynhild laughed
and ᚦe buildiᛝ echᛟd
Only once
wiᚦ all her hᛠrt
Loᛝ ᛲall ye joy
in lands and men
Now ye have slain
ᚦe hero noble

11
ᚦen Guᚦrun spake
ᚦe daughter of Gjuki
Much ᚦou spᛠkeᛥ
in evil speech
Accursed be Gunnar
Sigurᚦs killer
Veᛝᛠnce ᛲall come
for his cruel hᛠrt

12
ᛠrly came eveniᛝ
and ale was drunk
And amoᛝ ᚦem loᛝ
and loud ᚦey talked
ᚦey slumbered all
when ᚦeir beds ᚦey sought
But Gunnar alone
was loᛝ awake

13
His feet were tossiᛝ
he talked to himself
And ᚦe slayer of hoᛥs
began to heed
What ᚦe twain from ᚦe tree
had told him ᚦen
ᚦe raven and ᛠgle
as home ᚦey rode

14
Brynhild awoke
ᚦe daughter of Buᚦli
ᚦe warriors daughter
ere dawn of day
Love me or hate me
ᚦe harm is done
And my grief cries out
or else I die

15
Silent were all
who hᛠrd her spᛠk
And nought of ᚦe hᛠrt
of ᚦe queen ᚦey knew
Who wept such tᛠrs
ᚦe ᚦiᛝ to tell
ᚦat laughiᛝ once
of ᚦe men ᛲe had won
Brynhild spake

16
Gunnar I drᛠmed
a drᛠm full grim
In ᚦe hall were corpses
cold was my bed
And ruler ᚦou
didᛥ joyless ride
Wiᚦ fetters bound
in ᚦe fᛟmens ᚦroᛝ

17


Utterly now
your Nifluᛝ race
All ᛲall die
your oaᚦs ye have broken

18
ᚦou haᛥ Gunnar
ᚦe deed forgot
When blᛳd in your fᛳtprints
boᚦ ye miᛝled
All to him
haᛥ repaid wiᚦ ill
Who fain had made ᚦee
ᚦe foremoᛥ of kiᛝs

19
Well did he prove
when proud he rode
To win me ᚦen
ᚦy wife to be
How true ᚦe hoᛥslayer
ever had held
ᚦe oaᚦs he had made
wiᚦ ᚦe monarch youᛝ

20
ᚦe woundᛥaff ᚦen
all wound wiᚦ gold
