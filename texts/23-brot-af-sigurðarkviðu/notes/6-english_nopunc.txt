The fire raged 
the earth was rocked
The flames leaped high 
to heaven itself
Few were the hardy 
heroes would dare
To ride or leap 
the raging flames 
Sigurth urged Grani 
then with his sword
The fire slackened 
before the hero
The flames sank low 
for the greedy of fame
The armor flashed 
that Regin had fashioned 
 
Sigurth the dragon 
slew and that
Will men recall 
while the world remains
But little boldness 
thy brother had
To ride or leap 
the raging flames 
 
Forth went Sigurth 
and speech he sought not
The friend of heroes 
his head bowed down
Such was his grief 
that asunder burst
His mailcoat all 
of iron wrought 
        

Hogni spake

1
What evil deed 
has Sigurth done
That the heros life 
thou fain wouldst have 
Gunnar spake

2
Sigurth oaths 
to me hath sworn
Oaths hath sworn 
and all hath broken
He betrayed me there 
where truest all
His oaths methinks 
he ought to have kept 
Hogni spake

3
Thy heart hath Brynhild 
whetted to hate
Evil to work 
and harm to win
She grudges the honor 
that Guthrun has
And that joy of herself 
thou still dost have 

4
They cooked a wolf 
they cut up a snake
They gave to Gotthorm 
the greedy ones flesh
Before the men 
to murder minded
Laid their hands 
on the hero bold 

5
Slain was Sigurth 
south of the Rhine
From a limb a raven 
called full loud
Your blood shall redden 
Atlis blade
And your oaths shall bind 
you both in chains 

6
Without stood Guthrun 
Gjukis daughter
Hear now the speech 
that first she spake
Where is Sigurth now 
the noble king
That my kinsmen riding 
before him come 

7
Only this 
did Hogni answer
Sigurth we 
with our swords have slain
The gray horse mourns 
by his master dead 

8
Then Brynhild spake 
the daughter of Buthli
Well shall ye joy 
in weapons and lands
Sigurth alone 
of all had been lord
If a little longer 
his life had been 

9
Right were it not 
that so he should rule
Oer Gjukis wealth 
and the race of the Goths
Five are the sons 
for ruling the folk
And greedy of fight 
that he hath fathered 

10
Then Brynhild laughed 
and the building echoed
Only once 
with all her heart
Long shall ye joy 
in lands and men
Now ye have slain 
the hero noble 

11
Then Guthrun spake 
the daughter of Gjuki
Much thou speakest 
in evil speech
Accursed be Gunnar 
Sigurths killer
Vengeance shall come 
for his cruel heart 

12
Early came evening 
and ale was drunk
And among them long 
and loud they talked
They slumbered all 
when their beds they sought
But Gunnar alone 
was long awake 

13
His feet were tossing 
he talked to himself
And the slayer of hosts 
began to heed
What the twain from the tree 
had told him then
The raven and eagle 
as home they rode 

14
Brynhild awoke 
the daughter of Buthli
The warriors daughter 
ere dawn of day
Love me or hate me 
the harm is done
And my grief cries out 
or else I die 

15
Silent were all 
who heard her speak
And nought of the heart 
of the queen they knew
Who wept such tears 
the thing to tell
That laughing once 
of the men she had won 
Brynhild spake

16
Gunnar I dreamed 
a dream full grim
In the hall were corpses 
cold was my bed
And ruler thou 
didst joyless ride
With fetters bound 
in the foemens throng

17
    
    
Utterly now 
your Niflung race
All shall die 
your oaths ye have broken 

18
Thou hast Gunnar 
the deed forgot
When blood in your footprints 
both ye mingled
All to him 
hast repaid with ill
Who fain had made thee 
the foremost of kings 

19
Well did he prove 
when proud he rode
To win me then 
thy wife to be
How true the hostslayer 
ever had held
The oaths he had made 
with the monarch young 

20
The woundstaff then 
all wound with gold
