Wake thee Groa 
wake mother good
At the doors of the dead I call thee
Thy son bethink thee 
thou badst to seek
Thy help at the hill of death 
Groa spake
2
What evil vexes 
mine only son
What baleful fate hast thou found
That thou callest thy mother 
who lies in the mould
And the world of the living has left 
Svipdag spake
3
The woman false 
whom my father embraced
Has brought me a baleful game
For she bade me go forth 
where none may fare
And Mengloth the maid to seek 
Groa spake
4
Long is the way 
long must thou wander
But long is love as well
Thou mayst find perchance 
what thou fain wouldst have
If the fates their favor will give 
Svipdag spake
5
Charms full good 
then chant to me mother
And seek thy son to guard
For death do I fear 
on the way I shall fare
And in years am I young methinks 
Groa spake
6
Then first I will chant thee 
the charm ofttried
That Rani taught to Rind
From the shoulder whateer 
mislikes thee shake
For helper thyself shalt thou have 
7
Then next I will chant thee 
if needs thou must travel
And wander a purposeless way
The bolts of Urth 
shall on every side
Be thy guards on the road thou goest 
8
Then third I will chant thee 
if threatening streams
The danger of death shall bring
Yet to Hel shall turn 
both Horn and Ruth
And before thee the waters shall fail 
9
Then fourth I will chant thee 
if come thy foes
On the gallowsway against thee
Into thine hands 
shall their hearts be given
And peace shall the warriors wish 
10
Then fifth I will chant thee 
if fetters perchance
Shall bind thy bending limbs
Oer thy thighs do I chant 
a looseningcharm
And the lock is burst from the limbs
And the fetters fall from the feet 
11
Then sixth I will chant thee 
if storms on the sea
Have might unknown to man
Yet never shall wind 
or wave do harm
And calm is the course of thy boat 
12
Then seventh I chant thee 
if frost shall seek
To kill thee on lofty crags
The fatal cold 
shall not grip thy flesh
And whole thy body shall be 
13
Then eighth will I chant thee 
if ever by night
Thou shalt wander on murky ways
Yet never the curse 
of a Christian woman
From the dead shall do thee harm 
14
Then ninth will I chant thee 
if needs thou must strive
With a warlike giant in words
Thy heart good store 
of wit shall have
And thy mouth of words full wise 
15
Now fare on the way 
where danger waits
Let evils not lessen thy love
I have stood at the door 
of the earthfixed stones
The while I chanted thee charms 
16
Bear hence my son 
what thy mother hath said
And let it live in thy breast
Thine ever shall be the 
best of fortune
So long as my words shall last
