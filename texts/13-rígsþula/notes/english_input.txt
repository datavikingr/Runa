They tell in old stories that one of the gods, whose name was Heimdall, went on his way along a certain seashore, and came to a dwelling, where he called himself Rig. 
According to these stories is the following poem: 
1.
Men say there went |
by ways so green
Of old the god, |
the aged and wise,
Mighty and strong |
did Rig go striding.
2.
Forward he went |
on the midmost way,
He came to a dwelling, |
a door on its posts;
In did he fare, |
on the floor was a fire,
Two hoary ones |
by the hearth there sat,
Ai and Edda, |
in olden dress. 
3.
Rig knew well |
wise words to speak,
Soon in the midst |
of the room he sat,
And on either side |
the others were. 
4.
A loaf of bread |
did Edda bring,
Heavy and thick |
and swollen with husks;
Forth on the table |
she set the fare,
And broth for the meal |
in a bowl there was.
(Calf's flesh boiled |
was the best of the dainties.) 
5.
Rig knew well |
wise words to speak,
Thence did he rise, |
made ready to sleep;
Soon in the bed |
himself did he lay,
And on either side |
the others were. 
6.
Thus was he there |
for three nights long,
Then forward he went |
on the midmost way,
And so nine months |
were soon passed by. 
7.
A son bore Edda, |
with water they sprinkled him,
With a cloth his hair |
so black they covered;
Thræll they named him, |
8.
The skin was wrinkled |
and rough on his hands,
Knotted his knuckles, |
Thick his fingers, |
and ugly his face,
Twisted his back, |
and big his heels. 
9.
He began to grow, |
and to gain in strength,
Soon of his might |
good use he made;
With bast he bound, |
and burdens carried,
Home bore faggots |
the whole day long. 
10.
One came to their home, |
crooked her legs,
Stained were her feet, |
and sunburned her arms,
Flat was her nose; |
her name was Thir. 
11.
Soon in the midst |
of the room she sat,
By her side there sat |
the son of the house;
They whispered both, |
and the bed made ready,
Thræll and Thir, |
till the day was through. 
12.
Children they had, |
they lived and were happy,
Fjosnir and Klur |
they were called, methinks,
Hreim and Kleggi, |
Kefsir, Fulnir,
Drumb, Digraldi, |
Drott and Leggjaldi,
Lut and Hosvir; |
the house they cared for,
Ground they dunged, |
and swine they guarded,
Goats they tended, |
and turf they dug. 
13.
Daughters had they, |
Drumba and Kumba,
Ökkvinkalfa, |
Arinnefja,
Ysja and Ambott, |
Eikintjasna,
Totrughypja |
and Tronubeina;
And thence has risen |
the race of thralls. 
14.
Forward went Rig, |
his road was straight,
To a hall he came, |
and a door there hung;
In did he fare, |
on the floor was a fire:
Afi and Amma |
owned the house. 
15.
There sat the twain, |
and worked at their tasks:
The man hewed wood |
for the weaver's beam;
His beard was trimmed, |
o'er his brow a curl,
His clothes fitted close; |
in the corner a chest. 
16.
The woman sat |
and the distaff wielded,
At the weaving with arms |
outstretched she worked;
On her head was a band, |
on her breast a smock;
On her shoulders a kerchief |
with clasps there was.
17.
Rig knew well |
wise words to speak,
Soon in the midst |
of the room he sat,
And on either side |
the others were.
18.
Then took Amma |
The vessels full |
with the fare she set,
Calf's flesh boiled |
was the best of the dainties. 
19.
Rig knew well |
wise words to speak,
He rose from the board, |
made ready to sleep;
Soon in the bed |
himself did he lay,
And on either side |
the others were. 
20.
Thus was he there |
for three nights long,
Then forward he went |
on the midmost way,
And so nine months |
were soon passed by. 
21.
A son bore Amma, |
with water they sprinkled him,
Karl they named him; |
in a cloth she wrapped him,
He was ruddy of face, |
and flashing his eyes. 
22.
He began to grow, |
and to gain in strength,
Oxen he ruled, |
and plows made ready,
Houses he built, |
and barns he fashioned,
Carts he made, |
and the plow he managed. 
23.
Home did they bring |
the bride for Karl,
In goatskins clad, |
and keys she bore;
Snör was her name, |
'neath the veil she sat;
A home they made ready, |
and rings exchanged,
The bed they decked, |
and a dwelling made. 
24.
Sons they had, |
they lived and were happy:
Hal and Dreng, |
Holth, Thegn and Smith,
Breith and Bondi, |
Bundinskeggi,
Bui and Boddi, |
Brattskegg and Segg. 
25.
Daughters they had, |
and their names are here:
Snot, Bruth, Svanni, |
Svarri, Sprakki,
Fljoth, Sprund and Vif, |
Feima, Ristil:
And thence has risen |
the yeomen's race. 
26.
Thence went Rig, |
his road was straight,
A hall he saw, |
the doors faced south;
The portal stood wide, |
on the posts was a ring, 
Then in he fared; |
the floor was strewn.
27.
Within two gazed |
in each other's eyes,
Fathir and Mothir, |
and played with their fingers; 
There sat the house-lord, |
wound strings for the bow,
Shafts he fashioned, |
and bows he shaped.
28.
The lady sat, |
at her arms she looked,
She smoothed the cloth, |
and fitted the sleeves; 
Gay was her cap, |
on her breast were clasps,
Broad was her train, |
of blue was her gown,
Her brows were bright, |
her breast was shining,
Whiter her neck |
than new-fallen snow. 
29.
Rig knew |
well wise words to speak,
Soon in the midst |
of the room he sat,
And on either side |
the others were. 
30.
Then Mothir brought |
a broidered cloth,
Of linen bright, |
and the board she covered;
And then she took |
the loaves so thin,
And laid them, white |
from the wheat, on the cloth. 
31.
Then forth she brought |
the vessels full,
With silver covered, |
and set before them,
Meat all browned, |
and well-cooked birds;
In the pitcher was wine, |
of plate were the cups,
So drank they and talked |
till the day was gone. 
32.
Rig knew well |
wise words to speak,
Soon did he rise, |
made ready to sleep;
So in the bed |
himself did he lay,
And on either side |
the others were.
33.
Thus was he there |
for three nights long,
Then forward he went |
on the midmost way,
And so nine months |
were soon passed by. 
34.
A son had Mothir, |
in silk they wrapped him,
With water they sprinkled him, |
Jarl he was;
Blond was his hair, |
and bright his cheeks,
Grim as a snake's |
were his glowing eyes. 
35.
To grow in the house |
did Jarl begin,
Shields he brandished, |
and bow-strings wound,
Bows he shot, |
and shafts he fashioned,
Arrows he loosened, |
and lances wielded,
Horses he rode, |
and hounds unleashed,
Swords he handled, |
and sounds he swam. 
36.
Straight from the grove |
came striding Rig,
Rig came striding, |
and runes he taught him;
By his name he called him, |
as son he claimed him,
And bade him hold |
his heritage wide,
His heritage wide, |
the ancient homes. 
37.
Forward he rode |
through the forest dark,
O'er the frosty crags, |
till a hall he found.
38.
His spear he shook, |
his shield he brandished,
His horse he spurred, |
with his sword he hewed;
Wars he raised, |
and reddened the field,
Warriors slew he, |
and land he won. 
39.
Eighteen halls |
ere long did he hold,
Wealth did he get, |
and gave to all,
Stones and jewels |
and slim-flanked steeds,
Rings he offered, |
and arm-rings shared. 
40.
His messengers went |
by the ways so wet,
And came to the hall |
where Hersir dwelt;
His daughter was fair |
and slender-fingered,
Erna the wise |
the maiden was. 
41.
Her hand they sought, |
and home they brought her,
Wedded to Jarl |
the veil she wore;
Together they dwelt, |
their joy was great,
Children they had, |
and happy they lived. 
42.
Bur was the eldest, |
and Barn the next,
Joth and Athal, |
Arfi, Mog,
Nith and Svein, |
soon they began-
Sun and Nithjung-- |
to play and swim;
Kund was one, |
and the youngest Kon. 
43.
Soon grew up |
the sons of Jarl,
Beasts they tamed, |
and bucklers rounded,
Shafts they fashioned, |
and spears they shook. 
44.
But Kon the Young |
learned runes to use,
Runes everlasting, |
the runes of life;
Soon could he well |
the warriors shield,
Dull the swordblade, |
and still the seas. 
45.
Bird-chatter learned he, |
flames could he lessen,
Minds could quiet, |
and sorrows calm;
The might and strength |
of twice four men. 
46.
With Rig-Jarl soon |
the runes he shared,
More crafty he was, |
and greater his wisdom;
The right he sought, |
and soon he won it,
Rig to be called, |
and runes to know. 
47.
Young Kon rode forth |
through forest and grove,
Shafts let loose, |
and birds he lured; 
There spake a crow |
on a bough that sat:
"Why lurest thou, Kon, |
the birds to come?
48.
"‚Twere better forth |
on thy steed to fare,
and the host to slay. 
49.
"The halls of Dan |
and Danp are noble,
Greater their wealth |
than thou bast gained;
Good are they |
at guiding the keel,
Trying of weapons, |
and giving of wounds.
