Grᛠt ᚦe evils
once ᚦat grew
Wiᚦ ᚦe dawniᛝ sad
of ᚦe sorrow of elves
In ᛠrly morn
awake for men
ᚦe evils ᚦat grief
to ᛠch ᛲall briᛝ
2
Not now nor yet
of yeᛥerday was it
Loᛝ ᚦe time
ᚦat since haᚦ lapsed
So ᚦat little ᚦere is
ᚦat is half as old
Since Guᚦrun daughter
of Gjuki whetted
Her sons so youᛝ
to Svanhilds veᛝᛠnce
3
ᚦe siᛥer ye had
was Svanhild called
And her did Jormunrek
trample wiᚦ horses
White and black
on ᚦe battleway
Gray roadwonted
ᚦe ᛥeeds of ᚦe Goᚦs
4
Little ᚦe kiᛝs
of ᚦe folk are ye like
For now ye are liviᛝ
alone of my race
5
Lonely am I
as ᚦe foreᛥ aspen
Of kindred bare
as ᚦe fir of its boughs
My joys are all loᛥ
as ᚦe lᛠves of ᚦe tree
When ᚦe scaᚦer of twigs
from ᚦe warm day turns
6
ᚦen Hamᚦer spake forᚦ
ᚦe high of hᛠrt
Small praise didᛥ ᚦou Guᚦrun
to Hognis deed give
When ᚦey wakened ᚦy Sigurᚦ
from out of his sleep
ᚦou didᛥ sit on ᚦe bed
while his slayers laughed
7
ᚦy bedcovers white
wiᚦ blᛳd were red
From his wounds and wiᚦ gore
of ᚦy husband were wet
So Sigurᚦ was slain
by his corpse didᛥ ᚦou sit
And of gladness didᛥ ᚦink not
twas Gunnars doiᛝ
8
ᚦou wouldᛥ ᛥrike at Atli
by ᚦe slayiᛝ of Erp
And ᚦe killiᛝ of Eitil
ᚦine own grief was worse
So ᛲould ᛠch one wield
ᚦe woundbitiᛝ sword
ᚦat anoᚦer it slays
but smites not himself
9
ᚦen did Sorli spᛠk out
for wise was he ever
Wiᚦ my moᚦer I never
a quarrel will make
Full little in spᛠkiᛝ
meᚦinks ye boᚦ lack
What askeᛥ ᚦou Guᚦrun
ᚦat will give ᚦee no tᛠrs
10
For ᚦy broᚦers doᛥ weep
and ᚦy boys so sweet
ᚦy kinsmen in birᚦ
on ᚦe battlefield slain
Now Guᚦrun as well
for us boᚦ ᛲalt ᚦou weep
We sit dᛳmed on our ᛥeeds
and far hence ᛲall we die
11
ᚦen ᚦe fameglad one
on ᚦe ᛥeps ᛲe was
ᚦe slenderfiᛝered
spake wiᚦ her son
Ye ᛲall daᛝer have
if counsel ye heed not
By two herᛟs alone
ᛲall two hundred of Goᚦs
Be bound or be slain
in ᚦe loftywalled burg
12
From ᚦe courtyard ᚦey fared
and fury ᚦey brᛠᚦed
ᚦe youᚦs swiftly went
ᛟr ᚦe mountain wet
On ᚦeir Hunniᛲ ᛥeeds
dᛠᚦs veᛝᛠnce to have
13
On ᚦe way ᚦey found
ᚦe man so wise
What help from ᚦe wᛠkliᛝ
brown may we have
14
So answered ᚦem
ᚦeir halfbroᚦer ᚦen
So well may I
my kinsmen aid
As help one fᛳt
from ᚦe oᚦer has
15
How may afᛳt
its fellow aid
Or a fleᛲgrown hand
anoᚦer help
16
ᚦen Erp spake forᚦ
his words were few
As haughty he sat
on his horses back
To ᚦe timid tis ill
ᚦe way to tell
A baᛥard ᚦey
ᚦe bold one called
17
From ᚦeir ᛲᛠᚦs ᚦey drew
ᚦeir ᛲiniᛝ swords
ᚦeir blades to ᚦe giantess
joy to give
By a ᚦird ᚦey lessened
ᚦe might ᚦat was ᚦeirs
ᚦe fighter youᛝ
to ᛠrᚦ ᚦey felled
18
ᚦeir cloaks ᚦey ᛲᛳk
ᚦeir swords ᚦey ᛲᛠᚦed
ᚦe highborn men
wrapped ᚦeir mantles close
19
On ᚦeir road ᚦey fared
and an ill way found
And ᚦeir siᛥers son
on a tree ᚦey saw
On ᚦe windcold wolftree
weᛥ of ᚦe hall
And cranesbait crawled
none would care to liᛝer
20
In ᚦe hall was din
ᚦe men drank deep
And ᚦe horses hᛳfs
could no one hᛠr
Till ᚦe warrior hardy
sounded his horn
21
Men came and ᚦe tale
to Jormunrek told
How warriors helmed
wiᚦout ᚦey beheld
Take counsel wise
for brave ones are come
Of mighty men
ᚦou ᚦe siᛥer didᛥ murder
22
ᚦen Jormunrek laughed
his hand laid on his bᛠrd
His arms for wiᚦ wine
he was warlike he called for
He ᛲᛳk his brown locks
on his white ᛲield he lᛳked
And raised high ᚦe cup
of gold in his hand
23
Happy meᚦinks
were I to behold
Hamᚦer and Sorli
here in my hall
ᚦe men would I bind
wiᚦ ᛥriᛝs of bows
And Gjukis heirs
on ᚦe gallows haᛝ
24
In ᚦe hall was clamor
ᚦe cups were ᛲattered
Men ᛥᛳd in blᛳd
from ᚦe brᛠᛥs of ᚦe Goᚦs
25
ᚦen did Hamᚦer spᛠk forᚦ
ᚦe haughty of hᛠrt
ᚦou soughteᛥ Jormunrek
us to see
Sons of one moᚦer
seekiᛝ ᚦy dwelliᛝ
ᚦou seeᛥ ᚦy hands
ᚦy feet ᚦou beholdeᛥ
Jormunrek fluᛝ
in ᚦe fire so hot
26
ᚦen roared ᚦe kiᛝ
of ᚦe race of ᚦe gods
Bold in his armor
as roars a bᛠr
ᛥone ye ᚦe men
ᚦat ᛥeel will bite not
Sword nor spᛠr
ᚦe sons of Jonak
Sorli spake
27
Ill didᛥ win broᚦer
when ᚦe bag ᚦou didᛥ open
Oft from ᚦat bag
came baleful counsel
Hᛠrt haᛥ ᚦou Hamᚦer
if knowledge ᚦou hadᛥ
A man wiᚦout wisdom
is lackiᛝ in much
Hamᚦer spake
28
His hᛠd were now off
if Erp were liviᛝ
ᚦe broᚦer so keen
whom we killed on our road
ᚦe warrior noble
twas ᚦe Norns ᚦat drove me
ᚦe hero to slay
who in fight ᛲould be holy
29
In faᛲion of wolves
it befits us not
Amoᛝᛥ ourselves to ᛥrive
Like ᚦe hounds of ᚦe Norns
ᚦat nouriᛲed were
In greed mid waᛥes so grim
30
We have grᛠtly fought
ᛟr ᚦe Goᚦs do we ᛥand
By our blades laid low
like ᛠgles on branches
Grᛠt our fame ᚦough we die
today or tomorrow
None outlives ᚦe night
when ᚦe Norris have spoken
31
ᚦen Sorli beside
ᚦe gable sank
And Hamᚦer fell
at ᚦe back of ᚦe house
ᚦis is called ᚦe old ballad of Hamᚦer
