1.
Great the evils |
once that grew,
With the dawning sad |
of the sorrow of elves;
In early morn |
awake for men
The evils that grief |
to each shall bring. 
2.
Not now, nor yet |
of yesterday was it,
Long the time |
that since hath lapsed,
So that little there is |
that is half as old,
Since Guthrun, daughter |
of Gjuki, whetted
Her sons so young |
to Svanhild's vengeance. 
3.
"The sister ye had |
was Svanhild called,
And her did Jormunrek |
trample with horses,
White and black |
on the battle-way,
Gray, road-wonted, |
the steeds of the Goths. 
4.
"Little the kings |
of the folk are ye like,
For now ye are living |
alone of my race. 
5.
"Lonely am I |
as the forest aspen,
Of kindred bare |
as the fir of its boughs,
My joys are all lost |
as the leaves of the tree
When the scather of twigs |
from the warm day turns." 
6.
Then Hamther spake forth, |
the high of heart:
"Small praise didst thou, Guthrun, |
to Hogni's deed give
When they wakened thy Sigurth |
from out of his sleep,
Thou didst sit on the bed |
while his slayers laughed. 
7.
"Thy bed-covers white |
with blood were red
From his wounds, and with gore |
of thy husband were wet;
So Sigurth was slain, |
by his corpse didst thou sit,
And of gladness didst think not: |
'twas Gunnar's doing. 
8.
"Thou wouldst strike at Atli |
by the slaying of Erp
And the killing of Eitil; |
thine own grief was worse;
So should each one wield |
the wound-biting sword
That another it slays |
but smites not himself." 
9.
Then did Sorli speak out, |
for wise was he ever:
"With my mother I never |
a quarrel will make;
Full little in speaking |
methinks ye both lack;
What askest thou, Guthrun, |
that will give thee no tears? 
10.
"For thy brothers dost weep, |
and thy boys so sweet,
Thy kinsmen in birth |
on the battlefield slain;
Now, Guthrun, as; well |
for us both shalt thou weep,
We sit doomed on our steeds, |
and far hence shall we die." 
11.
Then the fame-glad one-- |
on the steps she was--
The slender-fingered, |
spake with her son:
"Ye shall danger have |
if counsel ye heed not;
By two heroes alone |
shall two hundred of Goths
Be bound or be slain |
in the lofty-walled burg."
12.
From the courtyard they fared, |
and fury they breathed;
The youths swiftly went |
o'er the mountain wet,
On their Hunnish steeds, |
death's vengeance to have.
13.
On the way they found |
the man so wise;
"What help from the weakling |
brown may we have?"
14.
So answered them |
their half-brother then:
"So well may I |
my kinsmen aid
As help one foot |
from the other has."
15.
"How may afoot |
its fellow aid,
Or a flesh-grown hand |
another help?"
16.
Then Erp spake forth, |
his words were few,
As haughty he sat |
on his horse's back:
"To the timid 'tis ill |
the way to tell."
A bastard they |
the bold one called. 
17.
From their sheaths they drew |
their shining swords,
Their blades, to the giantess |
joy to give;
By a third they lessened |
the might that was theirs,
The fighter young |
to earth they felled. 
18.
Their cloaks they shook, |
their swords they sheathed,
The high-born men |
wrapped their mantles close. 
19.
On their road they fared |
and an ill way found,
And their sister's son |
on a tree they saw,
On the wind-cold wolf-tree |
west of the hall,
And cranes'-bait crawled; |
none would care to linger. 
20.
In the hall was din, |
the men drank deep,
And the horses' hoofs |
could no one hear,
Till the warrior hardy |
sounded his horn. 
21.
Men came and the tale |
to Jormunrek told
How warriors helmed |
without they beheld:
"Take counsel wise, |
for brave ones are come,
Of mighty men |
thou the sister didst murder." 
22.
Then Jormunrek laughed, |
his hand laid on his beard,
His arms, for with wine |
he was warlike, he called for;
He shook his brown locks, |
on his white shield he looked,
And raised high the cup |
of gold in his hand. 
23.
"Happy, methinks, |
were I to behold
Hamther and Sorli |
here in my hall;
The men would I bind |
with strings of bows,
And Gjuki's heirs |
on the gallows hang." 
24.
In the hall was clamor, |
the cups were shattered,
Men stood in blood |
from the breasts of the Goths, 
25.
Then did Hamther speak forth, |
the haughty of heart:
"Thou soughtest, Jormunrek, |
us to see,
Sons of one mother |
seeking thy dwelling;
Thou seest thy hands, |
thy feet thou beholdest,
Jormunrek, flung |
in the fire so hot." 
26.
Then roared the king, |
of the race of the gods,
Bold in his armor, |
as roars a bear:
"Stone ye the men |
that steel will bite not,
Sword nor spear, |
the sons of Jonak." 
Sorli spake:
27.
"Ill didst win, brother, |
when the bag thou didst open,
Oft from that bag |
came baleful counsel; 
Heart hast thou, Hamther, |
if knowledge thou hadst!
A man without wisdom |
is lacking in much." 
Hamther spake:
28.
"His head were now off |
if Erp were living,
The brother so keen |
whom we killed on our road,
The warrior noble,-- |
'twas the Norns that drove me
The hero to slay |
who in fight should be holy. 
29.
"In fashion of wolves |
it befits us not
Amongst ourselves to strive,
Like the hounds of the Norns, |
that nourished were
In greed mid wastes so grim. 
30.
"We have greatly fought, |
o'er the Goths do we stand
By our blades laid low, |
like eagles on branches;
Great our fame though we die |
today or tomorrow;
None outlives the night |
when the Norris have spoken." 
31.
Then Sorli beside |
the gable sank,
And Hamther fell |
at the back of the house. 
This is called the old ballad of Hamther.
