1.
There are many who know |
how of old did men
In counsel gather; |
little good did they get;
In secret they plotted, |
it was sore for them later,
And for Gjuki's sons, |
whose trust they deceived. 

2.
Fate grew for the princes, |
to death they were given;
Ill counsel was Atli's, |
though keenness he had;
He felled his staunch bulwark, |
his own sorrow fashioned,
Soon a message he sent |
that his kinsmen should seek him. 

3.
Wise was the woman, |
she fain would use wisdom,
She saw well what meant |
all they said in secret;
From her heart it was hid |
how help she might render,
The sea they should sail, |
while herself she should go not. 

4.
Runes did she fashion, |
but false Vingi made them,
The speeder of hatred, |
ere to give them he sought;
Then soon fared the warriors |
whom Atli had sent,
And to Limafjord came, |
to the home of the kings. 

5.
They were kindly with ale, |
and fires they kindled,
They thought not of craft |
from the guests who had come;
The gifts did they take |
that the noble one gave them,
On the pillars they hung them, |
no fear did they harbor. 

6.
Forth did Kostbera, wife |
of Hogni, then come,
Full kindly she was, |
and she welcomed them both;
And glad too was Glaumvor, |
the wife of Gunnar,
She knew well to care |
for the needs of the guests. 

7.
Then Hogni they asked |
if more eager he were,
Full clear was the guile, |
if on guard they had been;
Then Gunnar made promise, |
if Hogni would go,
And Hogni made answer |
as the other counseled. 

8.
Then the famed ones brought mead, |
and fair was the feast,
Full many were the horns, |
till the men had drunk deep;
Then the mates made ready |
their beds for resting.

9.
Wise was Kostbera, |
and cunning in rune-craft,
The letters would she read |
by the light of the fire;
But full quickly her tongue |
to her palate clave,
So strange did they seem |
that their meaning she saw not. 

10.
Full soon then his bed |
came Hogni to seek,
The clear-souled one dreamed, |
and her dream she kept not,
To the warrior the wise one |
spake when she wakened: 

11.
"Thou wouldst go hence, |
Hogni, but heed my counsel,--
Known to few are the runes,-- |
and put off thy faring;
I have read now the runes |
that thy sister wrote,
And this time the bright one |
did not bid thee to come. 

12.
"Full much do I wonder, |
nor well can I see,
Why the woman wise |
so wildly hath written;
But to me it seems |
that the meaning beneath
Is that both shall be slain |
if soon ye shall go.
But one rune she missed, |
or else others have marred it." 
Hogni spake:

13.
"All women are fearful; |
not so do I feel,
Ill I seek not to find |
till I soon must avenge it;
The king now will give us |
the glow-ruddy gold;
I never shall fear, |
though of dangers I know." 
Kostbera spake:

14.
"In danger ye fare, |
if forth ye go thither,
No welcoming friendly |
this time shall ye find;
For I dreamed now, Hogni, |
and nought will I hide,
Full evil thy faring, |
if rightly I fear. 

15.
"Thy bed-covering saw I |
in the flames burning,
And the fire burst high |
through the walls of my home." 
Hogni spake:
"Yon garment of linen |
lies little of worth,
It will soon be burned, |
so thou sawest the bed-cover." 
Kostbera spake:

16.
"A bear saw I enter, |
the pillars he broke,
And he brandished his claws |
so that craven we were;
With his mouth seized he many, |
and nought was our might,
And loud was the tumult, |
not little it was." 
Hogni spake:

17.
"Now a storm is brewing, |
and wild it grows swiftly,
A dream of an ice-bear |
means a gale from the east." 
Kostbera spake:

18.
"An eagle I saw flying |
from the end through the house,
Our fate must be bad, |
for with blood he sprinkled us;
From the evil I fear |
that 'twas Atli's spirit." 
Hogni spake:

19.
"They will slaughter soon, |
and so blood do we see,
Oft oxen it means |
when of eagles one dreams;
True is Atli's heart, |
whatever thou dreamest." 
Then silent they were, |
and nought further they said. 

20.
The high-born ones wakened, |
and like speech they had,
Then did Glaumvor tell |
how in terror she dreamed,
. . . . . Gunnar |
two roads they should go. 
Glaumvor spake:

21.
"A gallows saw I ready, |
thou didst go to thy hanging,
Thy flesh serpents ate, |
and yet living I found thee;
The gods' doom descended; |
now say what it boded." 

22.
"A sword drawn bloody |
from thy garments I saw,--
Such a dream is hard |
to a husband to tell,--
A spear stood, methought, |
through thy body thrust,
And at head and feet |
the wolves were howling." 
Gunnar spake:

23.
"The hounds are running, |
loud their barking is heard,
Oft hounds' clamor follows |
the flying of spears." 
Glaumvor spake:

24.
"A river the length |
of the hall saw I run,
Full swiftly it roared, |
o'er the benches it swept;
O'er the feet did it break |
of ye brothers twain,
The water would yield not; |
some meaning there was." 

25.
"I dreamed that by night |
came dead women hither,
Sad were their garments, |
and thee were they seeking;
They bade thee come swiftly |
forth to their benches,
And nothing, methinks, |
could the Norns avail thee." 
Gunnar spake:

26.
"Too late is thy speaking, |
for so is it settled
From the faring I turn not, |
the going is fixed,
Though likely it is |
that our lives shall be short." 

27.
Then bright shone the morning, |
the men all were ready,
They said, and yet each |
would the other hold back;
Five were the warriors, |
and their followers all
But twice as many,-- |
their minds knew not wisdom.

28.
Sn√¶var and Solar, |
they were sons of Hogni,
Orkning was he called |
who came with the others,
Blithe was the shield-tree, |
the brother of Kostbera; 
The fair-decked ones followed, |
till the fjord divided them,
Full hard did they plead, |
but the others would hear not. 

29.
Then did Glaumvor speak forth, |
the wife of Gunnar,
To Vingi she said |
that which wise to her seemed:
"I know not if well |
thou requitest our welcome,
Full ill was thy coming |
if evil shall follow." 
30. Then did Vingi swear, |
and full glib was his speech,
"May giants now take me |
if lies I have told ye,
And the gallows if hostile |
thought did I have." 

31.
Then did Bera speak forth, |
and fair was her thought,
"May ye sail now happy, |
and victory have,
To fare as I bid ye, |
may nought your way bar." 

32.
Then Hogni made answer,-- |
dear held he his kin,-
"Take courage, ye wise ones, |
whatsoever may come;
Though many may speak, |
yet is evil oft mighty,
And words avail little |
to lead one homeward." 

33.
They tenderly looked |
till each turned on his way,
Then with changing fate |
were their farings divided. 

34.
Full stoutly they rowed, |
and the keel clove asunder,
Their backs strained at the oars, |
and their strength was fierce;
The oar-loops were burst, |
the thole-pins, were broken,
Nor the ship made they fast |
ere from her they fared. 

35.
Not long was it after-- |
the end must I tell--
That the home they beheld |
that Buthli once had;
Loud the gates resounded |
when Hogni smote them;
Vingi spake then a word |
that were better unsaid: 

36.
"Go ye far from the house, |
for false is its entrance,
Soon shall I burn you, |
ye are swiftly smitten;
I bade ye come fairly, |
but falseness was under,
Now bide ye afar |
while your gallows I fashion." 

37.
Then Hogni made answer, |
his heart yielded little,
And nought did he fear |
that his fate held in store:
"Seek not to affright us, |
thou shalt seldom succeed;
If thy words are more, |
then the worse grows thy fate." 

38.
Then Vingi did they smite, |
and they sent him to hell,
With their axes they clove him |
while the death rattle came. 

39.
Atli summoned his men, |
in mail-coats they hastened,
All ready they came, |
and between was the courtyard.

40.
Then came they to words, |
and full wrathful they were:
"Long since did we plan |
how soon we might slay you." 
Hogni spake:

41.
"Little it matters |
if long ye have planned it;
For unarmed do ye wait, |
and one have we felled,
We smote him to hell, |
of your host was he once." 

42.
Then wild was their anger |
when all heard his words;
Their fingers were swift |
on their bowstrings to seize,
Full sharply they shot, |
by their shields were they guarded. 

43.
In the house came the word |
how the heroes without
Fought in front of the hall; |
they heard a thrall tell it; 
Grim then was Guthrun, |
the grief when she heard,
With necklaces fair, |
and she flung them all from her,
(The silver she hurled |
so the rings burst asunder.) 

44.
Then out did she go, |
she flung open the doors,
All fearless she went, |
and the guests did she welcome;
To the Niflungs she went-- |
her last greeting it was,--
In her speech truth was clear, |
and much would she speak. 

45.
"For your safety I sought |
that at home ye should stay;
None escapes his fate, |
so ye hither must fare."
Full wisely she spake, |
if yet peace they might win,
But to nought would they hearken, |
and "No" said they all. 

46.
Then the high-born one saw |
that hard was their battle,
In fierceness of heart |
she flung off her mantle;
Her naked sword grasped she |
her kin's lives to guard,
Not gentle her hands |
in the hewing of battle. 

47.
Then the daughter of Gjuki |
two warriors smote down,
Atli's brother she slew, |
and forth then they bore him;
(So fiercely she fought |
that his feet she clove off;) 
Another she smote |
so that never he stood,
To hell did she send him,-- |
her hands trembled never. 

48.
Full wide was the fame |
of the battle they fought,
'Twas the greatest of deeds |
of the sons of Gjuki;
Men say that the Niflungs, |
while themselves they were living,
With their swords fought mightily, |
mail-coats they sundered,
And helms did they hew, |
as their hearts were fearless. 

49.
All the morning they fought |
until midday shone,
(All the dusk as well |
and the dawning of day,)
When the battle was ended, |
the field flowed with blood;
Ere they fell, eighteen |
of their foemen were slain,
By the two sons of Bera |
and her brother as well. 

50.
Then the warrior spake, |
and wild was his anger:
"This is evil to see, |
and thy doing is all;
Once we were thirty, |
we thanes, keen for battle,
Now eleven are left, |
and great is our lack. 

51.
"There were five of us brothers |
when Buthli we lost,
Now Hel has the half, |
and two smitten lie here; 
A great kinship had I,-- |
the truth may I hide not,--
From a wife bringing slaughter |
small joy could I win.

52.
We lay seldom together |
since to me thou wast given,
Now my kin all are gone, |
of my gold am I robbed;
Nay, and worst, thou didst send |
my sister to hell." 
Guthrun spake:

53.
"Hear me now, Atli! |
the first evil was thine;
My mother didst thou take, |
and for gold didst murder her,
My sister's daughter |
thou didst starve in a prison.
A jest does it seem |
that thy sorrow thou tellest,
And good do I find it |
that grief to thee comes." 
Atli spake:

54.
"Go now, ye warriors, |
and make greater the grief
Of the woman so fair, |
for fain would I see it;
So fierce be thy warring |
that Guthrun shall weep,
I would gladly behold |
her happiness lost. 

55.
"Seize ye now Hogni, |
and with knives shall ye hew him,
His heart shall ye cut out, |
this haste ye to do;
And grim-hearted Gunnar |
shall ye bind on the gallows,
Swift shall ye do it, |
to serpents now cast him." 
Hogni spake:

56.
"Do now as thou wilt, |
for glad I await it,
Brave shalt thou find me, |
I have faced worse before;
We held thee at bay |
while whole we were fighting,
Now with wounds are we spent, |
so thy will canst thou work." 

57.
Then did Beiti speak, |
he was Atli's steward:
"Let us seize now Hjalli, |
and Hogni spare we!
Let us fell the sluggard, |
he is fit for death,
He has lived too long, |
and lazy men call him." 

58.
Afraid was the pot-watcher, |
he fled here and yon,
And crazed with his terror |
he climbed in the corners:
"Ill for me is this fighting, |
if I pay for your fierceness,
And sad is the day |
to die leaving my swine
And all the fair victuals |
that of old did I have." 

59.
They seized Buthli's cook, |
and they came with the knife,
The frightened thrall howled |
ere the edge did he feel;
He was willing, he cried, |
to dung well the courtyard,
Do the basest of work, |
if spare him they would;
Full happy were Hjalli |
if his life he might have. 

60.
Then fain was Hogni-- |
there are few would do thus--
To beg for the slave |
that safe hence he should go;
"I would find it far better |
this knife-play to feel,
Why must we all hark |
to this howling longer?" 

61.
Then the brave one they seized; |
to the warriors bold
No chance was there left |
to delay his fate longer;
Loud did Hogni laugh, |
all the sons of day heard him,
So valiant he was |
that well he could suffer. 

62.
A harp Gunnar seized, |
with his toes he smote it
So well did he strike |
that the women all wept,
And the men, when clear |
they heard it, lamented;
Full noble was his song, |
the rafters burst asunder. 

63.
Then the heroes died |
ere the day was yet come;
Their fame did they leave |
ever lofty to live.

64.
Full mighty seemed Atli |
as o'er them he stood,
The wise one he blamed, |
and his words reproached her:
"It is morning, Guthrun; |
now thy dear ones dost miss,
But the blame is part thine |
that thus it has chanced." 
Guthrun spake:

65.
"Thou art joyous, Atli, |
for of evil thou tellest,
But sorrow is thine |
if thou mightest all see;
Thy heritage heavy |
here can I tell thee,
Sorrow never thou losest |
unless I shall die." 
Atli spake:

66.
"Not free of guilt am I; |
a way shall I find
That is better by far,-- |
oft the fairest we shunned;--
With slaves I console thee, |
with gems fair to see,
And with silver snow-white, |
as thyself thou shalt choose." 
Guthrun spake:

67.
"No hope shall this give thee, |
thy gifts I shall take not,
Requital I spurned |
when my sorrows were smaller;
Once grim did I seem, |
but now greater my grimness,
There was nought seemed too hard |
while Hogni was living. 

68.
"Our childhood did we have |
in a single house,
We played many a game, |
in the grove did we grow;
Then did Grimhild give us |
gold and necklaces,
Thou shalt ne'er make amends |
for my brother's murder,
Nor ever shalt win me |
to think it was well. 

69.
"But the fierceness of men |
rules the fate of women,
The tree-top bows low |
if bereft of its leaves,
The tree bends over |
if the roots are cleft under it;
Now mayest thou, Atli, |
o'er all things here rule." 

70.
Full heedless the warrior |
was that he trusted her,
So clear was her guile |
if on guard he had been;
But crafty was Guthrun, |
with cunning she spake,
Her glance she made pleasant, |
with two shields she played. 

71.
The beer then she brought |
for her brothers' death feast,
And a feast Atli made |
for his followers dead; 
No more did they speak, |
the mead was made ready,
Soon the men were gathered |
with mighty uproar.

72.
Thus bitterly planned she, |
and Buthli's race threatened,
And terrible vengeance |
on her husband would take; 
The little ones called she, |
on a block she laid them;
Afraid were the proud ones, |
but their tears did not fall;
To their mother's arms went they, |
and asked what she would. 
Guthrun spake:

73.
"Nay, ask me no more! |
You both shall I murder,
For long have I wished |
your lives to steal from you."
The boys spake:
"Slay thy boys as thou wilt, |
for no one may bar it,
Short the angry one's peace |
if all thou shalt do." 

74.
Then the grim one slew both |
of the brothers young,
Full hard was her deed |
when their heads she smote off;
Fain was Atli to know |
whither now they were gone,
The boys from their sport, |
for nowhere he spied them. 
Guthrun spake:

75.
"My fate shall I seek, |
all to Atli saying,
The daughter of Grimhild |
the deed from thee hides not;
No joy thou hast, Atli, |
if all thou shalt hear,
Great sorrow didst wake |
when my brothers thou slewest. 

76.
'I have seldom slept |
since the hour they were slain,
Baleful were my threats, |
now I bid thee recall them;
Thou didst say it was morning,-- |
too well I remember,--
Now is evening come, |
and this question thou askest. 

77.
"Now both of thy sons |
thou hast lost . . .
as thou never shouldst do;
The skulls of thy boys |
thou as beer-cups didst have,
And the draught that I made thee |
was mixed with their blood. 

78.
'I cut out their hearts, |
on a spit I cooked them,
I came to thee with them, |
and calf's flesh I called them;
Alone didst thou eat them, |
nor any didst leave,
Thou didst greedily bite, |
and thy teeth were busy. 

79.
"Of thy sons now thou knowest; |
few suffer more sorrow;
My guilt have I told, |
fame it never shall give me." 
Atli spake:

80.
"Grim wast thou, Guthrun, |
in so grievous a deed,
My draught with the blood |
of thy boys to mingle;
Thou hast slain thine own kin, |
most ill it be seemed thee,
And little for me |
twixt my sorrows thou leavest." 
Guthrun spake:

81.
"Still more would I seek |
to slay thee thyself,
Enough ill comes seldom |
to such as thou art;
Thou didst folly of old, |
such that no one shall find
In the whole world of men |
a match for such madness.
Now this that of late |
we learned hast thou added,
Great evil hast grasped, |
and thine own death feast made." 
Atli spake:

82.
"With fire shall they burn thee, |
and first shall they stone thee,
So then hast thou earned |
what thou ever hast sought for."
Guthrun spake:
"Such woes for thyself |
shalt thou say in the morning,
From a finer death I |
to another light fare." 

83.
Together they sat |
and full grim were their thoughts,
Unfriendly their words, |
and no joy either found;
In Hniflung grew hatred, |
great plans did he have,
To Guthrun his anger |
against Atli was told. 

84.
To her heart came ever |
the fate of Hogni,
She told him 'twere well |
if he vengeance should win;
So was Atli slain,-- |
'twas not slow to await,--
Hogni's son slew him, |
and Guthrun herself. 

85.
Then the warrior spake, |
as from slumber he wakened,
Soon he knew for his wounds |
would the bandage do nought:
"Now the truth shalt thou say: |
who has slain Buthli's son?
Full sore am I smitten, |
nor hope can I see." 
Guthrun spake:

86.
"Ne'er her deed from thee hides |
the daughter of Grimhild,
I own to the guilt |
that is ending thy life,
And the son of Hogni; |
'tis so thy wounds bleed." 
Atli spake:
"To murder hast thou fared, |
though foul it must seem;
Ill thy friend to betray |
who trusted thee well. 

87.
"Not glad went I hence |
thy hand to seek, Guthrun,
In thy widowhood famed, |
but haughty men found thee;
My belief did not lie, |
as now we have learned;
I brought thee home hither, |
and a host of men with us. 

88.
"Most noble was all |
when of old we journeyed,
Great honor did we have |
of heroes full worthy;
Of cattle had we plenty, |
and greatly we prospered,
Mighty was our wealth, |
and many received it. 

89.
"To the famed one as bride-gift |
I gave jewels fair,
I gave thirty slaves, |
and handmaidens seven;
There was honor in such gifts, |
yet the silver was greater. 

90.
"But all to thee was |
as if nought it were worth,
While the land lay before thee |
that Buthli had left me;
Thou in secret didst work |
so the treasure I won not;
My mother full oft |
to sit weeping didst make,
No wedded joy found I |
in fullness of heart." 
Guthrun spake:

91.
"Thou liest now, Atli, |
though little I heed it;
If I seldom was kindly, |
full cruel wast thou;
Ye brothers fought young, |
quarrels brought you to battle,
And half went to hell |
of the sons of thy house,
And all was destroyed |
that should e'er have done good. 

92.
"My two brothers and I |
were bold in our thoughts,
From the land we went forth, |
with Sigurth we fared;
Full swiftly we sailed, |
each one steering his ship,
So our fate sought we e'er |
till we came to the East. 

93.
"First the king did we slay, |
and the land we seized,
The princes did us service, |
for such was their fear;
From the forest we called |
them we fain would have guiltless,
And rich made we many |
who of all were bereft. 

94.
"Slain was the Hun-king, |
soon happiness vanished,
In her grief the widow |
so young sat weeping;
Yet worse seemed the sorrow |
to seek Atli's house,
A hero was my husband, |
and hard was his loss. 

95.
"From the Thing thou camst never, |
for thus have we heard,
Having won in thy quarrels, |
or warriors smitten;
Full yielding thou wast, |
never firm was thy will,
In silence didst suffer, |
Atli spake:

96.
"Thou liest now, Guthrun, |
but little of good
Will it bring to either, |
for all have we lost;
But, Guthrun, yet once |
be thou kindly of will,
For the honor of both, |
when forth I am borne." 
Guthrun spake:

97.
"A ship will I buy, |
and a bright-hued coffin,
I will wax well the shroud |
to wind round thy body,
For all will I care |
as if dear were we ever." 

98.
Then did Atli die, |
and his heirs' grief doubled;
The high-born one did |
as to him she had promised;
Then sought Guthrun the wise |
to go to her death,
But for days did she wait, |
and 'twas long ere she died. 

99.
Full happy shall he be |
who such offspring has,
Or children so gallant, |
as Gjuki begot;
Forever shall live, |
and in lands far and wide,
Their valor heroic |
wherever men hear it.
