ᚦere are many who know
how of old did men
In counsel gaᚦer
litle gᛳd did ᚦey get
In secret ᚦey ploted
it was sore for ᚦem later
And for Gjukis sons
whose truᛥ ᚦey deceived
2
Fate grew for ᚦe princes
to dᛠᚦ ᚦey were given
Il counsel was Atlis
ᚦough kenes he had
He feled his ᛥaunch bulwark
his own sorow faᛲioned
Sᛳn a mesage he sent
ᚦat his kinsmen ᛲould sek him
3
Wise was ᚦe woman
ᛲe fain would use wisdom
ᛲe saw wel what mᛠnt
al ᚦey said in secret
From her hᛠrt it was hid
how help ᛲe might render
ᚦe sᛠ ᚦey ᛲould sail
while herself ᛲe ᛲould go not
4
Runes did ᛲe faᛲion
but false Viᛝi made ᚦem
ᚦe speder of hatred
ere to give ᚦem he sought
ᚦen sᛳn fared ᚦe wariors
whom Atli had sent
And to Limafjord came
to ᚦe home of ᚦe kiᛝs
5
ᚦey were kindly wiᚦ ale
and fires ᚦey kindled
ᚦey ᚦought not of craft
from ᚦe gueᛥs who had come
ᚦe gifts did ᚦey take
ᚦat ᚦe noble one gave ᚦem
On ᚦe pilars ᚦey huᛝ ᚦem
no fᛠr did ᚦey harbor
6
Forᚦ did Koᛥbera wife
of Hogni ᚦen come
Ful kindly ᛲe was
and ᛲe welcomed ᚦem boᚦ
And glad tᛳ was Glaumvor
ᚦe wife of Gunar
ᛲe knew wel to care
for ᚦe neds of ᚦe gueᛥs
7
ᚦen Hogni ᚦey asked
if more ᛠger he were
Ful clᛠr was ᚦe guile
if on guard ᚦey had ben
ᚦen Gunar made promise
if Hogni would go
And Hogni made answer
as ᚦe oᚦer counseled
8
ᚦen ᚦe famed ones brought mᛠd
and fair was ᚦe fᛠᛥ
Ful many were ᚦe horns
til ᚦe men had drunk dep
ᚦen ᚦe mates made rᛠdy
ᚦeir beds for reᛥiᛝ
9
Wise was Koᛥbera
and cuniᛝ in runecraft
ᚦe leters would ᛲe rᛠd
by ᚦe light of ᚦe fire
But ful quickly her toᛝue
to her palate clave
So ᛥraᛝe did ᚦey sem
ᚦat ᚦeir mᛠniᛝ ᛲe saw not
10
Ful sᛳn ᚦen his bed
came Hogni to sek
ᚦe clᛠrsouled one drᛠmed
and her drᛠm ᛲe kept not
To ᚦe warior ᚦe wise one
spake when ᛲe wakened
1
ᚦou wouldᛥ go hence
Hogni but hed my counsel
Known to few are ᚦe runes
and put of ᚦy fariᛝ
I have rᛠd now ᚦe runes
ᚦat ᚦy siᛥer wrote
And ᚦis time ᚦe bright one
did not bid ᚦe to come
12
Ful much do I wonder
nor wel can I se
Why ᚦe woman wise
so wildly haᚦ writen
But to me it sems
ᚦat ᚦe mᛠniᛝ benᛠᚦ
Is ᚦat boᚦ ᛲal be slain
if sᛳn ye ᛲal go
But one rune ᛲe mised
or else oᚦers have mared it
Hogni spake
13
Al women are fᛠrful
not so do I fel
Il I sek not to find
til I sᛳn muᛥ aveᛝe it
ᚦe kiᛝ now wil give us
ᚦe glowrudy gold
I never ᛲal fᛠr
ᚦough of daᛝers I know
Koᛥbera spake
14
In daᛝer ye fare
if forᚦ ye go ᚦiᚦer
No welcomiᛝ friendly
ᚦis time ᛲal ye find
For I drᛠmed now Hogni
and nought wil I hide
Ful evil ᚦy fariᛝ
if rightly I fᛠr
15
ᚦy bedcoveriᛝ saw I
in ᚦe flames burniᛝ
And ᚦe fire burᛥ high
ᚦrough ᚦe wals of my home
Hogni spake
Yon garment of linen
lies litle of worᚦ
It wil sᛳn be burned
so ᚦou saweᛥ ᚦe bedcover
Koᛥbera spake
16
A bᛠr saw I enter
ᚦe pilars he broke
And he brandiᛲed his claws
so ᚦat craven we were
Wiᚦ his mouᚦ seized he many
and nought was our might
And loud was ᚦe tumult
not litle it was
Hogni spake
17
Now a ᛥorm is brewiᛝ
and wild it grows swiftly
A drᛠm of an icebᛠr
mᛠns a gale from ᚦe ᛠᛥ
Koᛥbera spake
18
An ᛠgle I saw flyiᛝ
from ᚦe end ᚦrough ᚦe house
Our fate muᛥ be bad
for wiᚦ blᛳd he sprinkled us
From ᚦe evil I fᛠr
ᚦat twas Atlis spirit
Hogni spake
19
ᚦey wil slaughter sᛳn
and so blᛳd do we se
Oft oxen it mᛠns
when of ᛠgles one drᛠms
True is Atlis hᛠrt
whatever ᚦou drᛠmeᛥ
ᚦen silent ᚦey were
and nought furᚦer ᚦey said
20
ᚦe highborn ones wakened
and like spech ᚦey had
ᚦen did Glaumvor tel
how in teror ᛲe drᛠmed
Gunar
two roads ᚦey ᛲould go
Glaumvor spake
21
A galows saw I rᛠdy
ᚦou didᛥ go to ᚦy haᛝiᛝ
ᚦy fleᛲ serpents ate
and yet liviᛝ I found ᚦe
ᚦe gods dᛳm descended
now say what it boded
2
A sword drawn blᛳdy
from ᚦy garments I saw
Such a drᛠm is hard
to a husband to tel
A spᛠr ᛥᛳd meᚦought
ᚦrough ᚦy body ᚦruᛥ
And at hᛠd and fet
ᚦe wolves were howliᛝ
Gunar spake
23
ᚦe hounds are runiᛝ
loud ᚦeir barkiᛝ is hᛠrd
Oft hounds clamor folows
ᚦe flyiᛝ of spᛠrs
Glaumvor spake
24
A river ᚦe leᛝᚦ
of ᚦe hal saw I run
Ful swiftly it roared
ᛟr ᚦe benches it swept
ᛟr ᚦe fet did it brᛠk
of ye broᚦers twain
ᚦe water would yield not
some mᛠniᛝ ᚦere was
25
I drᛠmed ᚦat by night
came dᛠd women hiᚦer
Sad were ᚦeir garments
and ᚦe were ᚦey sekiᛝ
ᚦey bade ᚦe come swiftly
forᚦ to ᚦeir benches
And noᚦiᛝ meᚦinks
could ᚦe Norns avail ᚦe
Gunar spake
26
Tᛳ late is ᚦy spᛠkiᛝ
for so is it setled
From ᚦe fariᛝ I turn not
ᚦe goiᛝ is fixed
ᚦough likely it is
ᚦat our lives ᛲal be ᛲort
27
ᚦen bright ᛲone ᚦe morniᛝ
ᚦe men al were rᛠdy
ᚦey said and yet ᛠch
would ᚦe oᚦer hold back
Five were ᚦe wariors
and ᚦeir folowers al
But twice as many
ᚦeir minds knew not wisdom
28
Snᚫvar and Solar
ᚦey were sons of Hogni
Orkniᛝ was he caled
who came wiᚦ ᚦe oᚦers
Bliᚦe was ᚦe ᛲieldtre
ᚦe broᚦer of Koᛥbera
ᚦe fairdecked ones folowed
til ᚦe fjord divided ᚦem
Ful hard did ᚦey plᛠd
but ᚦe oᚦers would hᛠr not
29
ᚦen did Glaumvor spᛠk forᚦ
ᚦe wife of Gunar
To Viᛝi ᛲe said
ᚦat which wise to her semed
I know not if wel
ᚦou requiteᛥ our welcome
Ful il was ᚦy comiᛝ
if evil ᛲal folow
30 ᚦen did Viᛝi swᛠr
and ful glib was his spech
May giants now take me
if lies I have told ye
And ᚦe galows if hoᛥile
ᚦought did I have
31
ᚦen did Bera spᛠk forᚦ
and fair was her ᚦought
May ye sail now hapy
and victory have
To fare as I bid ye
may nought your way bar
32
ᚦen Hogni made answer
dᛠr held he his kin
Take courage ye wise ones
whatsᛟver may come
ᚦough many may spᛠk
yet is evil oft mighty
And words avail litle
to lᛠd one homeward
3
ᚦey tenderly lᛳked
til ᛠch turned on his way
ᚦen wiᚦ chaᛝiᛝ fate
were ᚦeir fariᛝs divided
34
Ful ᛥoutly ᚦey rowed
and ᚦe kel clove asunder
ᚦeir backs ᛥrained at ᚦe oars
and ᚦeir ᛥreᛝᚦ was fierce
ᚦe oarlᛳps were burᛥ
ᚦe ᚦolepins were broken
Nor ᚦe ᛲip made ᚦey faᛥ
ere from her ᚦey fared
35
Not loᛝ was it after
ᚦe end muᛥ I tel
ᚦat ᚦe home ᚦey beheld
ᚦat Buᚦli once had
Loud ᚦe gates resounded
when Hogni smote ᚦem
Viᛝi spake ᚦen a word
ᚦat were beter unsaid
36
Go ye far from ᚦe house
for false is its entrance
Sᛳn ᛲal I burn you
ye are swiftly smiten
I bade ye come fairly
but falsenes was under
Now bide ye afar
while your galows I faᛲion
37
ᚦen Hogni made answer
his hᛠrt yielded litle
And nought did he fᛠr
ᚦat his fate held in ᛥore
Sek not to afright us
ᚦou ᛲalt seldom suced
If ᚦy words are more
ᚦen ᚦe worse grows ᚦy fate
38
ᚦen Viᛝi did ᚦey smite
and ᚦey sent him to hel
Wiᚦ ᚦeir axes ᚦey clove him
while ᚦe dᛠᚦ ratle came
39
Atli sumoned his men
in mailcoats ᚦey haᛥened
Al rᛠdy ᚦey came
and betwen was ᚦe courtyard
40
ᚦen came ᚦey to words
and ful wraᚦful ᚦey were
Loᛝ since did we plan
how sᛳn we might slay you
Hogni spake
41
Litle it maters
if loᛝ ye have planed it
For unarmed do ye wait
and one have we feled
We smote him to hel
of your hoᛥ was he once
42
ᚦen wild was ᚦeir aᛝer
when al hᛠrd his words
ᚦeir fiᛝers were swift
on ᚦeir bowᛥriᛝs to seize
Ful ᛲarply ᚦey ᛲot
by ᚦeir ᛲields were ᚦey guarded
43
In ᚦe house came ᚦe word
how ᚦe herᛟs wiᚦout
Fought in front of ᚦe hal
ᚦey hᛠrd a ᚦral tel it
Grim ᚦen was Guᚦrun
ᚦe grief when ᛲe hᛠrd
Wiᚦ necklaces fair
and ᛲe fluᛝ ᚦem al from her
ᚦe silver ᛲe hurled
so ᚦe riᛝs burᛥ asunder
4
ᚦen out did ᛲe go
ᛲe fluᛝ open ᚦe dᛳrs
Al fᛠrles ᛲe went
and ᚦe gueᛥs did ᛲe welcome
To ᚦe Nifluᛝs ᛲe went
her laᛥ gretiᛝ it was
In her spech truᚦ was clᛠr
and much would ᛲe spᛠk
45
For your safety I sought
ᚦat at home ye ᛲould ᛥay
None escapes his fate
so ye hiᚦer muᛥ fare
Ful wisely ᛲe spake
if yet pᛠce ᚦey might win
But to nought would ᚦey hᛠrken
and No said ᚦey al
46
ᚦen ᚦe highborn one saw
ᚦat hard was ᚦeir batle
In fiercenes of hᛠrt
ᛲe fluᛝ of her mantle
Her naked sword grasped ᛲe
her kins lives to guard
Not gentle her hands
in ᚦe hewiᛝ of batle
47
ᚦen ᚦe daughter of Gjuki
two wariors smote down
Atlis broᚦer ᛲe slew
and forᚦ ᚦen ᚦey bore him
So fiercely ᛲe fought
ᚦat his fet ᛲe clove of
Anoᚦer ᛲe smote
so ᚦat never he ᛥᛳd
To hel did ᛲe send him
her hands trembled never
48
Ful wide was ᚦe fame
of ᚦe batle ᚦey fought
Twas ᚦe grᛠteᛥ of deds
of ᚦe sons of Gjuki
Men say ᚦat ᚦe Nifluᛝs
while ᚦemselves ᚦey were liviᛝ
Wiᚦ ᚦeir swords fought mightily
mailcoats ᚦey sundered
And helms did ᚦey hew
as ᚦeir hᛠrts were fᛠrles
49
Al ᚦe morniᛝ ᚦey fought
until miday ᛲone
Al ᚦe dusk as wel
and ᚦe dawniᛝ of day
When ᚦe batle was ended
ᚦe field flowed wiᚦ blᛳd
Ere ᚦey fel eighten
of ᚦeir fᛟmen were slain
By ᚦe two sons of Bera
and her broᚦer as wel
50
ᚦen ᚦe warior spake
and wild was his aᛝer
ᚦis is evil to se
and ᚦy doiᛝ is al
Once we were ᚦirty
we ᚦanes ken for batle
Now eleven are left
and grᛠt is our lack
51
ᚦere were five of us broᚦers
when Buᚦli we loᛥ
Now Hel has ᚦe half
and two smiten lie here
A grᛠt kinᛲip had I
ᚦe truᚦ may I hide not
From a wife briᛝiᛝ slaughter
smal joy could I win
52
We lay seldom togeᚦer
since to me ᚦou waᛥ given
Now my kin al are gone
of my gold am I robed
Nay and worᛥ ᚦou didᛥ send
my siᛥer to hel
Guᚦrun spake
53
Hᛠr me now Atli
ᚦe firᛥ evil was ᚦine
My moᚦer didᛥ ᚦou take
and for gold didᛥ murder her
My siᛥers daughter
ᚦou didᛥ ᛥarve in a prison
A jeᛥ dᛟs it sem
ᚦat ᚦy sorow ᚦou teleᛥ
And gᛳd do I find it
ᚦat grief to ᚦe comes
Atli spake
54
Go now ye wariors
and make grᛠter ᚦe grief
Of ᚦe woman so fair
for fain would I se it
So fierce be ᚦy wariᛝ
ᚦat Guᚦrun ᛲal wep
I would gladly behold
her hapines loᛥ
5
Seize ye now Hogni
and wiᚦ knives ᛲal ye hew him
His hᛠrt ᛲal ye cut out
ᚦis haᛥe ye to do
And grimhᛠrted Gunar
ᛲal ye bind on ᚦe galows
Swift ᛲal ye do it
to serpents now caᛥ him
Hogni spake
56
Do now as ᚦou wilt
for glad I await it
Brave ᛲalt ᚦou find me
I have faced worse before
We held ᚦe at bay
while whole we were fightiᛝ
Now wiᚦ wounds are we spent
so ᚦy wil canᛥ ᚦou work
57
ᚦen did Beiti spᛠk
he was Atlis ᛥeward
Let us seize now Hjali
and Hogni spare we
Let us fel ᚦe slugard
he is fit for dᛠᚦ
He has lived tᛳ loᛝ
and lazy men cal him
58
Afraid was ᚦe potwatcher
he fled here and yon
And crazed wiᚦ his teror
he climbed in ᚦe corners
Il for me is ᚦis fightiᛝ
if I pay for your fiercenes
And sad is ᚦe day
to die lᛠviᛝ my swine
And al ᚦe fair victuals
ᚦat of old did I have
59
ᚦey seized Buᚦlis cᛳk
and ᚦey came wiᚦ ᚦe knife
ᚦe frightened ᚦral howled
ere ᚦe edge did he fel
He was wiliᛝ he cried
to duᛝ wel ᚦe courtyard
Do ᚦe baseᛥ of work
if spare him ᚦey would
Ful hapy were Hjali
if his life he might have
60
ᚦen fain was Hogni
ᚦere are few would do ᚦus
To beg for ᚦe slave
ᚦat safe hence he ᛲould go
I would find it far beter
ᚦis knifeplay to fel
Why muᛥ we al hark
to ᚦis howliᛝ loᛝer
61
ᚦen ᚦe brave one ᚦey seized
to ᚦe wariors bold
No chance was ᚦere left
to delay his fate loᛝer
Loud did Hogni laugh
al ᚦe sons of day hᛠrd him
So valiant he was
ᚦat wel he could sufer
62
A harp Gunar seized
wiᚦ his tᛟs he smote it
So wel did he ᛥrike
ᚦat ᚦe women al wept
And ᚦe men when clᛠr
ᚦey hᛠrd it lamented
Ful noble was his soᛝ
ᚦe rafters burᛥ asunder
63
ᚦen ᚦe herᛟs died
ere ᚦe day was yet come
ᚦeir fame did ᚦey lᛠve
ever lofty to live
64
Ful mighty semed Atli
as ᛟr ᚦem he ᛥᛳd
ᚦe wise one he blamed
and his words reproached her
It is morniᛝ Guᚦrun
now ᚦy dᛠr ones doᛥ mis
But ᚦe blame is part ᚦine
ᚦat ᚦus it has chanced
Guᚦrun spake
65
ᚦou art joyous Atli
for of evil ᚦou teleᛥ
But sorow is ᚦine
if ᚦou mighteᛥ al se
ᚦy heritage hᛠvy
here can I tel ᚦe
Sorow never ᚦou loseᛥ
unles I ᛲal die
Atli spake
6
Not fre of guilt am I
a way ᛲal I find
ᚦat is beter by far
oft ᚦe faireᛥ we ᛲuned
Wiᚦ slaves I console ᚦe
wiᚦ gems fair to se
And wiᚦ silver snowhite
as ᚦyself ᚦou ᛲalt chᛳse
Guᚦrun spake
67
No hope ᛲal ᚦis give ᚦe
ᚦy gifts I ᛲal take not
Requital I spurned
when my sorows were smaler
Once grim did I sem
but now grᛠter my grimnes
ᚦere was nought semed tᛳ hard
while Hogni was liviᛝ
68
Our childhᛳd did we have
in a siᛝle house
We played many a game
in ᚦe grove did we grow
ᚦen did Grimhild give us
gold and necklaces
ᚦou ᛲalt ner make amends
for my broᚦers murder
Nor ever ᛲalt win me
to ᚦink it was wel
69
But ᚦe fiercenes of men
rules ᚦe fate of women
ᚦe tretop bows low
if bereft of its lᛠves
ᚦe tre bends over
if ᚦe rᛳts are cleft under it
Now mayeᛥ ᚦou Atli
ᛟr al ᚦiᛝs here rule
70
Ful hedles ᚦe warior
was ᚦat he truᛥed her
So clᛠr was her guile
if on guard he had ben
But crafty was Guᚦrun
wiᚦ cuniᛝ ᛲe spake
Her glance ᛲe made plᛠsant
wiᚦ two ᛲields ᛲe played
71
ᚦe ber ᚦen ᛲe brought
for her broᚦers dᛠᚦ fᛠᛥ
And a fᛠᛥ Atli made
for his folowers dᛠd
No more did ᚦey spᛠk
ᚦe mᛠd was made rᛠdy
Sᛳn ᚦe men were gaᚦered
wiᚦ mighty uproar
72
ᚦus biterly planed ᛲe
and Buᚦlis race ᚦrᛠtened
And terible veᛝᛠnce
on her husband would take
ᚦe litle ones caled ᛲe
on a block ᛲe laid ᚦem
Afraid were ᚦe proud ones
but ᚦeir tᛠrs did not fal
To ᚦeir moᚦers arms went ᚦey
and asked what ᛲe would
Guᚦrun spake
73
Nay ask me no more
You boᚦ ᛲal I murder
For loᛝ have I wiᛲed
your lives to ᛥᛠl from you
ᚦe boys spake
Slay ᚦy boys as ᚦou wilt
for no one may bar it
ᛲort ᚦe aᛝry ones pᛠce
if al ᚦou ᛲalt do
74
ᚦen ᚦe grim one slew boᚦ
of ᚦe broᚦers youᛝ
Ful hard was her ded
when ᚦeir hᛠds ᛲe smote of
Fain was Atli to know
whiᚦer now ᚦey were gone
ᚦe boys from ᚦeir sport
for nowhere he spied ᚦem
Guᚦrun spake
75
My fate ᛲal I sek
al to Atli sayiᛝ
ᚦe daughter of Grimhild
ᚦe ded from ᚦe hides not
No joy ᚦou haᛥ Atli
if al ᚦou ᛲalt hᛠr
Grᛠt sorow didᛥ wake
when my broᚦers ᚦou sleweᛥ
76
I have seldom slept
since ᚦe hour ᚦey were slain
Baleful were my ᚦrᛠts
now I bid ᚦe recal ᚦem
ᚦou didᛥ say it was morniᛝ
tᛳ wel I remember
Now is eveniᛝ come
and ᚦis queᛥion ᚦou askeᛥ
7
Now boᚦ of ᚦy sons
ᚦou haᛥ loᛥ
as ᚦou never ᛲouldᛥ do
ᚦe skuls of ᚦy boys
ᚦou as bercups didᛥ have
And ᚦe draught ᚦat I made ᚦe
was mixed wiᚦ ᚦeir blᛳd
78
I cut out ᚦeir hᛠrts
on a spit I cᛳked ᚦem
I came to ᚦe wiᚦ ᚦem
and calfs fleᛲ I caled ᚦem
Alone didᛥ ᚦou ᛠt ᚦem
nor any didᛥ lᛠve
ᚦou didᛥ gredily bite
and ᚦy teᚦ were busy
79
Of ᚦy sons now ᚦou knoweᛥ
few sufer more sorow
My guilt have I told
fame it never ᛲal give me
Atli spake
80
Grim waᛥ ᚦou Guᚦrun

And litle for me

Guᚦrun spake
81
ᛥil more would I sek
to slay ᚦe ᚦyself
Enough il comes seldom
to such as ᚦou art
ᚦou didᛥ foly of old
such ᚦat no one ᛲal find
In ᚦe whole world of men
a match for such madnes
Now ᚦis ᚦat of late
we lᛠrned haᛥ ᚦou aded
Grᛠt evil haᛥ grasped
and ᚦine own dᛠᚦ fᛠᛥ made
Atli spake
82
Wiᚦ fire ᛲal ᚦey burn ᚦe

So ᚦen haᛥ ᚦou ᛠrned

Guᚦrun spake
Such wᛟs for ᚦyself
ᛲalt ᚦou say in ᚦe morniᛝ
From a finer dᛠᚦ I
to anoᚦer light fare
83
Togeᚦer ᚦey sat
and ful grim were ᚦeir ᚦoughts
Unfriendly ᚦeir words
and no joy eiᚦer found
In Hnifluᛝ grew hatred
grᛠt plans did he have
To Guᚦrun his aᛝer
againᛥ Atli was told
84
To her hᛠrt came ever
ᚦe fate of Hogni
ᛲe told him twere wel
if he veᛝᛠnce ᛲould win
So was Atli slain
twas not slow to await
Hognis son slew him
and Guᚦrun herself
85
ᚦen ᚦe warior spake
as from slumber he wakened
Sᛳn he knew for his wounds
would ᚦe bandage do nought
Now ᚦe truᚦ ᛲalt ᚦou say
who has slain Buᚦlis son
Ful sore am I smiten
nor hope can I se
Guᚦrun spake
86
Ner her ded from ᚦe hides
ᚦe daughter of Grimhild
I own to ᚦe guilt
ᚦat is endiᛝ ᚦy life
And ᚦe son of Hogni
tis so ᚦy wounds bled
Atli spake
To murder haᛥ ᚦou fared
ᚦough foul it muᛥ sem
Il ᚦy friend to betray
who truᛥed ᚦe wel
87
Not glad went I hence
ᚦy hand to sek Guᚦrun
In ᚦy widowhᛳd famed
but haughty men found ᚦe
My belief did not lie
as now we have lᛠrned
I brought ᚦe home hiᚦer
and a hoᛥ of men wiᚦ us
8
Moᛥ noble was al
when of old we journeyed
Grᛠt honor did we have
of herᛟs ful worᚦy
Of catle had we plenty
and grᛠtly we prospered
Mighty was our wᛠlᚦ
and many received it
89
To ᚦe famed one as bridegift
I gave jewels fair
I gave ᚦirty slaves
and handmaidens seven
ᚦere was honor in such gifts
yet ᚦe silver was grᛠter
90
But al to ᚦe was
as if nought it were worᚦ
While ᚦe land lay before ᚦe
ᚦat Buᚦli had left me
ᚦou in secret didᛥ work
so ᚦe trᛠsure I won not
My moᚦer ful oft
to sit wepiᛝ didᛥ make
No weded joy found I
in fulnes of hᛠrt
Guᚦrun spake
91
ᚦou lieᛥ now Atli
ᚦough litle I hed it
If I seldom was kindly
ful cruel waᛥ ᚦou
Ye broᚦers fought youᛝ
quarels brought you to batle
And half went to hel
of ᚦe sons of ᚦy house
And al was deᛥroyed
ᚦat ᛲould er have done gᛳd
92
My two broᚦers and I
were bold in our ᚦoughts
From ᚦe land we went forᚦ
wiᚦ Sigurᚦ we fared
Ful swiftly we sailed
ᛠch one ᛥeriᛝ his ᛲip
So our fate sought we er
til we came to ᚦe ᛠᛥ
93
Firᛥ ᚦe kiᛝ did we slay
and ᚦe land we seized
ᚦe princes did us service
for such was ᚦeir fᛠr
From ᚦe foreᛥ we caled
ᚦem we fain would have guiltles
And rich made we many
who of al were bereft
94
Slain was ᚦe Hunkiᛝ
sᛳn hapines vaniᛲed
In her grief ᚦe widow
so youᛝ sat wepiᛝ
Yet worse semed ᚦe sorow
to sek Atlis house
A hero was my husband
and hard was his los
95
From ᚦe ᚦiᛝ ᚦou camᛥ never
for ᚦus have we hᛠrd
Haviᛝ won in ᚦy quarels
or wariors smiten
Ful yieldiᛝ ᚦou waᛥ
never firm was ᚦy wil
In silence didᛥ sufer
Atli spake
96
ᚦou lieᛥ now Guᚦrun
but litle of gᛳd
Wil it briᛝ to eiᚦer
for al have we loᛥ
But Guᚦrun yet once
be ᚦou kindly of wil
For ᚦe honor of boᚦ
when forᚦ I am borne
Guᚦrun spake
97
A ᛲip wil I buy
and a brighᚦued cofin
I wil wax wel ᚦe ᛲroud
to wind round ᚦy body
For al wil I care
as if dᛠr were we ever
98
ᚦen did Atli die
and his heirs grief doubled
ᚦe highborn one did
as to him ᛲe had promised
ᚦen sought Guᚦrun ᚦe wise
to go to her dᛠᚦ
But for days did ᛲe wait
and twas loᛝ ere ᛲe died
9
Ful hapy ᛲal he be
who such ofspriᛝ has
Or children so galant
as Gjuki begot
Forever ᛲal live
and in lands far and wide
ᚦeir valor heroic
wherever men hᛠr it
