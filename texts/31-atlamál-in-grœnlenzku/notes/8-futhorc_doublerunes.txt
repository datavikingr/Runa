ᚦere are many who know
how of old did men
In counsel gaᚦer
little gᛳd did ᚦey get
In secret ᚦey plotted
it was sore for ᚦem later
And for Gjukis sons
whose truᛥ ᚦey deceived
2
Fate grew for ᚦe princes
to dᛠᚦ ᚦey were given
Ill counsel was Atlis
ᚦough keenness he had
He felled his ᛥaunch bulwark
his own sorrow faᛲioned
Sᛳn a message he sent
ᚦat his kinsmen ᛲould seek him
3
Wise was ᚦe woman
ᛲe fain would use wisdom
ᛲe saw well what mᛠnt
all ᚦey said in secret
From her hᛠrt it was hid
how help ᛲe might render
ᚦe sᛠ ᚦey ᛲould sail
while herself ᛲe ᛲould go not
4
Runes did ᛲe faᛲion
but false Viᛝi made ᚦem
ᚦe speeder of hatred
ere to give ᚦem he sought
ᚦen sᛳn fared ᚦe warriors
whom Atli had sent
And to Limafjord came
to ᚦe home of ᚦe kiᛝs
5
ᚦey were kindly wiᚦ ale
and fires ᚦey kindled
ᚦey ᚦought not of craft
from ᚦe gueᛥs who had come
ᚦe gifts did ᚦey take
ᚦat ᚦe noble one gave ᚦem
On ᚦe pillars ᚦey huᛝ ᚦem
no fᛠr did ᚦey harbor
6
Forᚦ did Koᛥbera wife
of Hogni ᚦen come
Full kindly ᛲe was
and ᛲe welcomed ᚦem boᚦ
And glad tᛳ was Glaumvor
ᚦe wife of Gunnar
ᛲe knew well to care
for ᚦe needs of ᚦe gueᛥs
7
ᚦen Hogni ᚦey asked
if more ᛠger he were
Full clᛠr was ᚦe guile
if on guard ᚦey had been
ᚦen Gunnar made promise
if Hogni would go
And Hogni made answer
as ᚦe oᚦer counseled
8
ᚦen ᚦe famed ones brought mᛠd
and fair was ᚦe fᛠᛥ
Full many were ᚦe horns
till ᚦe men had drunk deep
ᚦen ᚦe mates made rᛠdy
ᚦeir beds for reᛥiᛝ
9
Wise was Koᛥbera
and cunniᛝ in runecraft
ᚦe letters would ᛲe rᛠd
by ᚦe light of ᚦe fire
But full quickly her toᛝue
to her palate clave
So ᛥraᛝe did ᚦey seem
ᚦat ᚦeir mᛠniᛝ ᛲe saw not
10
Full sᛳn ᚦen his bed
came Hogni to seek
ᚦe clᛠrsouled one drᛠmed
and her drᛠm ᛲe kept not
To ᚦe warrior ᚦe wise one
spake when ᛲe wakened
11
ᚦou wouldᛥ go hence
Hogni but heed my counsel
Known to few are ᚦe runes
and put off ᚦy fariᛝ
I have rᛠd now ᚦe runes
ᚦat ᚦy siᛥer wrote
And ᚦis time ᚦe bright one
did not bid ᚦee to come
12
Full much do I wonder
nor well can I see
Why ᚦe woman wise
so wildly haᚦ written
But to me it seems
ᚦat ᚦe mᛠniᛝ benᛠᚦ
Is ᚦat boᚦ ᛲall be slain
if sᛳn ye ᛲall go
But one rune ᛲe missed
or else oᚦers have marred it
Hogni spake
13
All women are fᛠrful
not so do I feel
Ill I seek not to find
till I sᛳn muᛥ aveᛝe it
ᚦe kiᛝ now will give us
ᚦe glowruddy gold
I never ᛲall fᛠr
ᚦough of daᛝers I know
Koᛥbera spake
14
In daᛝer ye fare
if forᚦ ye go ᚦiᚦer
No welcomiᛝ friendly
ᚦis time ᛲall ye find
For I drᛠmed now Hogni
and nought will I hide
Full evil ᚦy fariᛝ
if rightly I fᛠr
15
ᚦy bedcoveriᛝ saw I
in ᚦe flames burniᛝ
And ᚦe fire burᛥ high
ᚦrough ᚦe walls of my home
Hogni spake
Yon garment of linen
lies little of worᚦ
It will sᛳn be burned
so ᚦou saweᛥ ᚦe bedcover
Koᛥbera spake
16
A bᛠr saw I enter
ᚦe pillars he broke
And he brandiᛲed his claws
so ᚦat craven we were
Wiᚦ his mouᚦ seized he many
and nought was our might
And loud was ᚦe tumult
not little it was
Hogni spake
17
Now a ᛥorm is brewiᛝ
and wild it grows swiftly
A drᛠm of an icebᛠr
mᛠns a gale from ᚦe ᛠᛥ
Koᛥbera spake
18
An ᛠgle I saw flyiᛝ
from ᚦe end ᚦrough ᚦe house
Our fate muᛥ be bad
for wiᚦ blᛳd he sprinkled us
From ᚦe evil I fᛠr
ᚦat twas Atlis spirit
Hogni spake
19
ᚦey will slaughter sᛳn
and so blᛳd do we see
Oft oxen it mᛠns
when of ᛠgles one drᛠms
True is Atlis hᛠrt
whatever ᚦou drᛠmeᛥ
ᚦen silent ᚦey were
and nought furᚦer ᚦey said
20
ᚦe highborn ones wakened
and like speech ᚦey had
ᚦen did Glaumvor tell
how in terror ᛲe drᛠmed
Gunnar
two roads ᚦey ᛲould go
Glaumvor spake
21
A gallows saw I rᛠdy
ᚦou didᛥ go to ᚦy haᛝiᛝ
ᚦy fleᛲ serpents ate
and yet liviᛝ I found ᚦee
ᚦe gods dᛳm descended
now say what it boded
22
A sword drawn blᛳdy
from ᚦy garments I saw
Such a drᛠm is hard
to a husband to tell
A spᛠr ᛥᛳd meᚦought
ᚦrough ᚦy body ᚦruᛥ
And at hᛠd and feet
ᚦe wolves were howliᛝ
Gunnar spake
23
ᚦe hounds are runniᛝ
loud ᚦeir barkiᛝ is hᛠrd
Oft hounds clamor follows
ᚦe flyiᛝ of spᛠrs
Glaumvor spake
24
A river ᚦe leᛝᚦ
of ᚦe hall saw I run
Full swiftly it roared
ᛟr ᚦe benches it swept
ᛟr ᚦe feet did it brᛠk
of ye broᚦers twain
ᚦe water would yield not
some mᛠniᛝ ᚦere was
25
I drᛠmed ᚦat by night
came dᛠd women hiᚦer
Sad were ᚦeir garments
and ᚦee were ᚦey seekiᛝ
ᚦey bade ᚦee come swiftly
forᚦ to ᚦeir benches
And noᚦiᛝ meᚦinks
could ᚦe Norns avail ᚦee
Gunnar spake
26
Tᛳ late is ᚦy spᛠkiᛝ
for so is it settled
From ᚦe fariᛝ I turn not
ᚦe goiᛝ is fixed
ᚦough likely it is
ᚦat our lives ᛲall be ᛲort
27
ᚦen bright ᛲone ᚦe morniᛝ
ᚦe men all were rᛠdy
ᚦey said and yet ᛠch
would ᚦe oᚦer hold back
Five were ᚦe warriors
and ᚦeir followers all
But twice as many
ᚦeir minds knew not wisdom
28
Snᚫvar and Solar
ᚦey were sons of Hogni
Orkniᛝ was he called
who came wiᚦ ᚦe oᚦers
Bliᚦe was ᚦe ᛲieldtree
ᚦe broᚦer of Koᛥbera
ᚦe fairdecked ones followed
till ᚦe fjord divided ᚦem
Full hard did ᚦey plᛠd
but ᚦe oᚦers would hᛠr not
29
ᚦen did Glaumvor spᛠk forᚦ
ᚦe wife of Gunnar
To Viᛝi ᛲe said
ᚦat which wise to her seemed
I know not if well
ᚦou requiteᛥ our welcome
Full ill was ᚦy comiᛝ
if evil ᛲall follow
30 ᚦen did Viᛝi swᛠr
and full glib was his speech
May giants now take me
if lies I have told ye
And ᚦe gallows if hoᛥile
ᚦought did I have
31
ᚦen did Bera spᛠk forᚦ
and fair was her ᚦought
May ye sail now happy
and victory have
To fare as I bid ye
may nought your way bar
32
ᚦen Hogni made answer
dᛠr held he his kin
Take courage ye wise ones
whatsᛟver may come
ᚦough many may spᛠk
yet is evil oft mighty
And words avail little
to lᛠd one homeward
33
ᚦey tenderly lᛳked
till ᛠch turned on his way
ᚦen wiᚦ chaᛝiᛝ fate
were ᚦeir fariᛝs divided
34
Full ᛥoutly ᚦey rowed
and ᚦe keel clove asunder
ᚦeir backs ᛥrained at ᚦe oars
and ᚦeir ᛥreᛝᚦ was fierce
ᚦe oarlᛳps were burᛥ
ᚦe ᚦolepins were broken
Nor ᚦe ᛲip made ᚦey faᛥ
ere from her ᚦey fared
35
Not loᛝ was it after
ᚦe end muᛥ I tell
ᚦat ᚦe home ᚦey beheld
ᚦat Buᚦli once had
Loud ᚦe gates resounded
when Hogni smote ᚦem
Viᛝi spake ᚦen a word
ᚦat were better unsaid
36
Go ye far from ᚦe house
for false is its entrance
Sᛳn ᛲall I burn you
ye are swiftly smitten
I bade ye come fairly
but falseness was under
Now bide ye afar
while your gallows I faᛲion
37
ᚦen Hogni made answer
his hᛠrt yielded little
And nought did he fᛠr
ᚦat his fate held in ᛥore
Seek not to affright us
ᚦou ᛲalt seldom succeed
If ᚦy words are more
ᚦen ᚦe worse grows ᚦy fate
38
ᚦen Viᛝi did ᚦey smite
and ᚦey sent him to hell
Wiᚦ ᚦeir axes ᚦey clove him
while ᚦe dᛠᚦ rattle came
39
Atli summoned his men
in mailcoats ᚦey haᛥened
All rᛠdy ᚦey came
and between was ᚦe courtyard
40
ᚦen came ᚦey to words
and full wraᚦful ᚦey were
Loᛝ since did we plan
how sᛳn we might slay you
Hogni spake
41
Little it matters
if loᛝ ye have planned it
For unarmed do ye wait
and one have we felled
We smote him to hell
of your hoᛥ was he once
42
ᚦen wild was ᚦeir aᛝer
when all hᛠrd his words
ᚦeir fiᛝers were swift
on ᚦeir bowᛥriᛝs to seize
Full ᛲarply ᚦey ᛲot
by ᚦeir ᛲields were ᚦey guarded
43
In ᚦe house came ᚦe word
how ᚦe herᛟs wiᚦout
Fought in front of ᚦe hall
ᚦey hᛠrd a ᚦrall tell it
Grim ᚦen was Guᚦrun
ᚦe grief when ᛲe hᛠrd
Wiᚦ necklaces fair
and ᛲe fluᛝ ᚦem all from her
ᚦe silver ᛲe hurled
so ᚦe riᛝs burᛥ asunder
44
ᚦen out did ᛲe go
ᛲe fluᛝ open ᚦe dᛳrs
All fᛠrless ᛲe went
and ᚦe gueᛥs did ᛲe welcome
To ᚦe Nifluᛝs ᛲe went
her laᛥ greetiᛝ it was
In her speech truᚦ was clᛠr
and much would ᛲe spᛠk
45
For your safety I sought
ᚦat at home ye ᛲould ᛥay
None escapes his fate
so ye hiᚦer muᛥ fare
Full wisely ᛲe spake
if yet pᛠce ᚦey might win
But to nought would ᚦey hᛠrken
and No said ᚦey all
46
ᚦen ᚦe highborn one saw
ᚦat hard was ᚦeir battle
In fierceness of hᛠrt
ᛲe fluᛝ off her mantle
Her naked sword grasped ᛲe
her kins lives to guard
Not gentle her hands
in ᚦe hewiᛝ of battle
47
ᚦen ᚦe daughter of Gjuki
two warriors smote down
Atlis broᚦer ᛲe slew
and forᚦ ᚦen ᚦey bore him
So fiercely ᛲe fought
ᚦat his feet ᛲe clove off
Anoᚦer ᛲe smote
so ᚦat never he ᛥᛳd
To hell did ᛲe send him
her hands trembled never
48
Full wide was ᚦe fame
of ᚦe battle ᚦey fought
Twas ᚦe grᛠteᛥ of deeds
of ᚦe sons of Gjuki
Men say ᚦat ᚦe Nifluᛝs
while ᚦemselves ᚦey were liviᛝ
Wiᚦ ᚦeir swords fought mightily
mailcoats ᚦey sundered
And helms did ᚦey hew
as ᚦeir hᛠrts were fᛠrless
49
All ᚦe morniᛝ ᚦey fought
until midday ᛲone
All ᚦe dusk as well
and ᚦe dawniᛝ of day
When ᚦe battle was ended
ᚦe field flowed wiᚦ blᛳd
Ere ᚦey fell eighteen
of ᚦeir fᛟmen were slain
By ᚦe two sons of Bera
and her broᚦer as well
50
ᚦen ᚦe warrior spake
and wild was his aᛝer
ᚦis is evil to see
and ᚦy doiᛝ is all
Once we were ᚦirty
we ᚦanes keen for battle
Now eleven are left
and grᛠt is our lack
51
ᚦere were five of us broᚦers
when Buᚦli we loᛥ
Now Hel has ᚦe half
and two smitten lie here
A grᛠt kinᛲip had I
ᚦe truᚦ may I hide not
From a wife briᛝiᛝ slaughter
small joy could I win
52
We lay seldom togeᚦer
since to me ᚦou waᛥ given
Now my kin all are gone
of my gold am I robbed
Nay and worᛥ ᚦou didᛥ send
my siᛥer to hell
Guᚦrun spake
53
Hᛠr me now Atli
ᚦe firᛥ evil was ᚦine
My moᚦer didᛥ ᚦou take
and for gold didᛥ murder her
My siᛥers daughter
ᚦou didᛥ ᛥarve in a prison
A jeᛥ dᛟs it seem
ᚦat ᚦy sorrow ᚦou telleᛥ
And gᛳd do I find it
ᚦat grief to ᚦee comes
Atli spake
54
Go now ye warriors
and make grᛠter ᚦe grief
Of ᚦe woman so fair
for fain would I see it
So fierce be ᚦy warriᛝ
ᚦat Guᚦrun ᛲall weep
I would gladly behold
her happiness loᛥ
55
Seize ye now Hogni
and wiᚦ knives ᛲall ye hew him
His hᛠrt ᛲall ye cut out
ᚦis haᛥe ye to do
And grimhᛠrted Gunnar
ᛲall ye bind on ᚦe gallows
Swift ᛲall ye do it
to serpents now caᛥ him
Hogni spake
56
Do now as ᚦou wilt
for glad I await it
Brave ᛲalt ᚦou find me
I have faced worse before
We held ᚦee at bay
while whole we were fightiᛝ
Now wiᚦ wounds are we spent
so ᚦy will canᛥ ᚦou work
57
ᚦen did Beiti spᛠk
he was Atlis ᛥeward
Let us seize now Hjalli
and Hogni spare we
Let us fell ᚦe sluggard
he is fit for dᛠᚦ
He has lived tᛳ loᛝ
and lazy men call him
58
Afraid was ᚦe potwatcher
he fled here and yon
And crazed wiᚦ his terror
he climbed in ᚦe corners
Ill for me is ᚦis fightiᛝ
if I pay for your fierceness
And sad is ᚦe day
to die lᛠviᛝ my swine
And all ᚦe fair victuals
ᚦat of old did I have
59
ᚦey seized Buᚦlis cᛳk
and ᚦey came wiᚦ ᚦe knife
ᚦe frightened ᚦrall howled
ere ᚦe edge did he feel
He was williᛝ he cried
to duᛝ well ᚦe courtyard
Do ᚦe baseᛥ of work
if spare him ᚦey would
Full happy were Hjalli
if his life he might have
60
ᚦen fain was Hogni
ᚦere are few would do ᚦus
To beg for ᚦe slave
ᚦat safe hence he ᛲould go
I would find it far better
ᚦis knifeplay to feel
Why muᛥ we all hark
to ᚦis howliᛝ loᛝer
61
ᚦen ᚦe brave one ᚦey seized
to ᚦe warriors bold
No chance was ᚦere left
to delay his fate loᛝer
Loud did Hogni laugh
all ᚦe sons of day hᛠrd him
So valiant he was
ᚦat well he could suffer
62
A harp Gunnar seized
wiᚦ his tᛟs he smote it
So well did he ᛥrike
ᚦat ᚦe women all wept
And ᚦe men when clᛠr
ᚦey hᛠrd it lamented
Full noble was his soᛝ
ᚦe rafters burᛥ asunder
63
ᚦen ᚦe herᛟs died
ere ᚦe day was yet come
ᚦeir fame did ᚦey lᛠve
ever lofty to live
64
Full mighty seemed Atli
as ᛟr ᚦem he ᛥᛳd
ᚦe wise one he blamed
and his words reproached her
It is morniᛝ Guᚦrun
now ᚦy dᛠr ones doᛥ miss
But ᚦe blame is part ᚦine
ᚦat ᚦus it has chanced
Guᚦrun spake
65
ᚦou art joyous Atli
for of evil ᚦou telleᛥ
But sorrow is ᚦine
if ᚦou mighteᛥ all see
ᚦy heritage hᛠvy
here can I tell ᚦee
Sorrow never ᚦou loseᛥ
unless I ᛲall die
Atli spake
66
Not free of guilt am I
a way ᛲall I find
ᚦat is better by far
oft ᚦe faireᛥ we ᛲunned
Wiᚦ slaves I console ᚦee
wiᚦ gems fair to see
And wiᚦ silver snowwhite
as ᚦyself ᚦou ᛲalt chᛳse
Guᚦrun spake
67
No hope ᛲall ᚦis give ᚦee
ᚦy gifts I ᛲall take not
Requital I spurned
when my sorrows were smaller
Once grim did I seem
but now grᛠter my grimness
ᚦere was nought seemed tᛳ hard
while Hogni was liviᛝ
68
Our childhᛳd did we have
in a siᛝle house
We played many a game
in ᚦe grove did we grow
ᚦen did Grimhild give us
gold and necklaces
ᚦou ᛲalt neer make amends
for my broᚦers murder
Nor ever ᛲalt win me
to ᚦink it was well
69
But ᚦe fierceness of men
rules ᚦe fate of women
ᚦe treetop bows low
if bereft of its lᛠves
ᚦe tree bends over
if ᚦe rᛳts are cleft under it
Now mayeᛥ ᚦou Atli
ᛟr all ᚦiᛝs here rule
70
Full heedless ᚦe warrior
was ᚦat he truᛥed her
So clᛠr was her guile
if on guard he had been
But crafty was Guᚦrun
wiᚦ cunniᛝ ᛲe spake
Her glance ᛲe made plᛠsant
wiᚦ two ᛲields ᛲe played
71
ᚦe beer ᚦen ᛲe brought
for her broᚦers dᛠᚦ fᛠᛥ
And a fᛠᛥ Atli made
for his followers dᛠd
No more did ᚦey spᛠk
ᚦe mᛠd was made rᛠdy
Sᛳn ᚦe men were gaᚦered
wiᚦ mighty uproar
72
ᚦus bitterly planned ᛲe
and Buᚦlis race ᚦrᛠtened
And terrible veᛝᛠnce
on her husband would take
ᚦe little ones called ᛲe
on a block ᛲe laid ᚦem
Afraid were ᚦe proud ones
but ᚦeir tᛠrs did not fall
To ᚦeir moᚦers arms went ᚦey
and asked what ᛲe would
Guᚦrun spake
73
Nay ask me no more
You boᚦ ᛲall I murder
For loᛝ have I wiᛲed
your lives to ᛥᛠl from you
ᚦe boys spake
Slay ᚦy boys as ᚦou wilt
for no one may bar it
ᛲort ᚦe aᛝry ones pᛠce
if all ᚦou ᛲalt do
74
ᚦen ᚦe grim one slew boᚦ
of ᚦe broᚦers youᛝ
Full hard was her deed
when ᚦeir hᛠds ᛲe smote off
Fain was Atli to know
whiᚦer now ᚦey were gone
ᚦe boys from ᚦeir sport
for nowhere he spied ᚦem
Guᚦrun spake
75
My fate ᛲall I seek
all to Atli sayiᛝ
ᚦe daughter of Grimhild
ᚦe deed from ᚦee hides not
No joy ᚦou haᛥ Atli
if all ᚦou ᛲalt hᛠr
Grᛠt sorrow didᛥ wake
when my broᚦers ᚦou sleweᛥ
76
I have seldom slept
since ᚦe hour ᚦey were slain
Baleful were my ᚦrᛠts
now I bid ᚦee recall ᚦem
ᚦou didᛥ say it was morniᛝ
tᛳ well I remember
Now is eveniᛝ come
and ᚦis queᛥion ᚦou askeᛥ
77
Now boᚦ of ᚦy sons
ᚦou haᛥ loᛥ
as ᚦou never ᛲouldᛥ do
ᚦe skulls of ᚦy boys
ᚦou as beercups didᛥ have
And ᚦe draught ᚦat I made ᚦee
was mixed wiᚦ ᚦeir blᛳd
78
I cut out ᚦeir hᛠrts
on a spit I cᛳked ᚦem
I came to ᚦee wiᚦ ᚦem
and calfs fleᛲ I called ᚦem
Alone didᛥ ᚦou ᛠt ᚦem
nor any didᛥ lᛠve
ᚦou didᛥ greedily bite
and ᚦy teeᚦ were busy
79
Of ᚦy sons now ᚦou knoweᛥ
few suffer more sorrow
My guilt have I told
fame it never ᛲall give me
Atli spake
80
Grim waᛥ ᚦou Guᚦrun
in so grievous a deed
My draught wiᚦ ᚦe blᛳd
of ᚦy boys to miᛝle
ᚦou haᛥ slain ᚦine own kin
moᛥ ill it be seemed ᚦee
And little for me
twixt my sorrows ᚦou lᛠveᛥ
Guᚦrun spake
81
ᛥill more would I seek
to slay ᚦee ᚦyself
Enough ill comes seldom
to such as ᚦou art
ᚦou didᛥ folly of old
such ᚦat no one ᛲall find
In ᚦe whole world of men
a match for such madness
Now ᚦis ᚦat of late
we lᛠrned haᛥ ᚦou added
Grᛠt evil haᛥ grasped
and ᚦine own dᛠᚦ fᛠᛥ made
Atli spake
82
Wiᚦ fire ᛲall ᚦey burn ᚦee
and firᛥ ᛲall ᚦey ᛥone ᚦee
So ᚦen haᛥ ᚦou ᛠrned
what ᚦou ever haᛥ sought for
Guᚦrun spake
Such wᛟs for ᚦyself
ᛲalt ᚦou say in ᚦe morniᛝ
From a finer dᛠᚦ I
to anoᚦer light fare
83
Togeᚦer ᚦey sat
and full grim were ᚦeir ᚦoughts
Unfriendly ᚦeir words
and no joy eiᚦer found
In Hnifluᛝ grew hatred
grᛠt plans did he have
To Guᚦrun his aᛝer
againᛥ Atli was told
84
To her hᛠrt came ever
ᚦe fate of Hogni
ᛲe told him twere well
if he veᛝᛠnce ᛲould win
So was Atli slain
twas not slow to await
Hognis son slew him
and Guᚦrun herself
85
ᚦen ᚦe warrior spake
as from slumber he wakened
Sᛳn he knew for his wounds
would ᚦe bandage do nought
Now ᚦe truᚦ ᛲalt ᚦou say
who has slain Buᚦlis son
Full sore am I smitten
nor hope can I see
Guᚦrun spake
86
Neer her deed from ᚦee hides
ᚦe daughter of Grimhild
I own to ᚦe guilt
ᚦat is endiᛝ ᚦy life
And ᚦe son of Hogni
tis so ᚦy wounds bleed
Atli spake
To murder haᛥ ᚦou fared
ᚦough foul it muᛥ seem
Ill ᚦy friend to betray
who truᛥed ᚦee well
87
Not glad went I hence
ᚦy hand to seek Guᚦrun
In ᚦy widowhᛳd famed
but haughty men found ᚦee
My belief did not lie
as now we have lᛠrned
I brought ᚦee home hiᚦer
and a hoᛥ of men wiᚦ us
88
Moᛥ noble was all
when of old we journeyed
Grᛠt honor did we have
of herᛟs full worᚦy
Of cattle had we plenty
and grᛠtly we prospered
Mighty was our wᛠlᚦ
and many received it
89
To ᚦe famed one as bridegift
I gave jewels fair
I gave ᚦirty slaves
and handmaidens seven
ᚦere was honor in such gifts
yet ᚦe silver was grᛠter
90
But all to ᚦee was
as if nought it were worᚦ
While ᚦe land lay before ᚦee
ᚦat Buᚦli had left me
ᚦou in secret didᛥ work
so ᚦe trᛠsure I won not
My moᚦer full oft
to sit weepiᛝ didᛥ make
No wedded joy found I
in fullness of hᛠrt
Guᚦrun spake
91
ᚦou lieᛥ now Atli
ᚦough little I heed it
If I seldom was kindly
full cruel waᛥ ᚦou
Ye broᚦers fought youᛝ
quarrels brought you to battle
And half went to hell
of ᚦe sons of ᚦy house
And all was deᛥroyed
ᚦat ᛲould eer have done gᛳd
92
My two broᚦers and I
were bold in our ᚦoughts
From ᚦe land we went forᚦ
wiᚦ Sigurᚦ we fared
Full swiftly we sailed
ᛠch one ᛥeeriᛝ his ᛲip
So our fate sought we eer
till we came to ᚦe ᛠᛥ
93
Firᛥ ᚦe kiᛝ did we slay
and ᚦe land we seized
ᚦe princes did us service
for such was ᚦeir fᛠr
From ᚦe foreᛥ we called
ᚦem we fain would have guiltless
And rich made we many
who of all were bereft
94
Slain was ᚦe Hunkiᛝ
sᛳn happiness vaniᛲed
In her grief ᚦe widow
so youᛝ sat weepiᛝ
Yet worse seemed ᚦe sorrow
to seek Atlis house
A hero was my husband
and hard was his loss
95
From ᚦe ᚦiᛝ ᚦou camᛥ never
for ᚦus have we hᛠrd
Haviᛝ won in ᚦy quarrels
or warriors smitten
Full yieldiᛝ ᚦou waᛥ
never firm was ᚦy will
In silence didᛥ suffer
Atli spake
96
ᚦou lieᛥ now Guᚦrun
but little of gᛳd
Will it briᛝ to eiᚦer
for all have we loᛥ
But Guᚦrun yet once
be ᚦou kindly of will
For ᚦe honor of boᚦ
when forᚦ I am borne
Guᚦrun spake
97
A ᛲip will I buy
and a brighᚦued coffin
I will wax well ᚦe ᛲroud
to wind round ᚦy body
For all will I care
as if dᛠr were we ever
98
ᚦen did Atli die
and his heirs grief doubled
ᚦe highborn one did
as to him ᛲe had promised
ᚦen sought Guᚦrun ᚦe wise
to go to her dᛠᚦ
But for days did ᛲe wait
and twas loᛝ ere ᛲe died
99
Full happy ᛲall he be
who such offspriᛝ has
Or children so gallant
as Gjuki begot
Forever ᛲall live
and in lands far and wide
ᚦeir valor heroic
wherever men hᛠr it
