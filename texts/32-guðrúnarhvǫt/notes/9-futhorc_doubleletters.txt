Guᚦrun went forᚦ to ᚦe sᛠ after ᛲe had slain Atli ᛲe went out into ᚦe sᛠ and fain would drown herself
but ᛲe could not sink
ᚦe waves bore her acros ᚦe fjord to ᚦe land of Kiᛝ Jonak
he tᛳk her as wife
ᚦeir sons were Sorli and Erp and Hamᚦer
ᚦere was brought up Svanhild Sigurᚦs daughter
ᛲe was maried to ᚦe mighty Jormunrek
Wiᚦ him was Biki
who counseled ᚦat Randver ᚦe kiᛝs son ᛲould have her
ᚦis Biki told to ᚦe kiᛝ
ᚦe kiᛝ had Randver haᛝed and Svanhild troden to dᛠᚦ under horses fet
And when Guᚦrun lᛠrned ᚦis ᛲe spake wiᚦ her sons
1
A wordᛥrife I lᛠrned
moᛥ wᛟful of al
A spech from ᚦe fulnes
of sorow spoken
When fierce of hᛠrt
her sons to ᚦe fight
Did Guᚦrun whet
wiᚦ words ful grim
2
Why sit ye idle
why slep out your lives
Why grieve ye not
in gladnes to spᛠk
Since Jormunrek
your siᛥer youᛝ
Benᛠᚦ ᚦe hᛳfs
of horses haᚦ troden
White and black
on ᚦe batleway
Gray roadwonted
ᚦe ᛥeds of ᚦe Goᚦs
3
Not like are ye
to Gunar of yore
Nor have ye hᛠrts
such as Hognis was
Veᛝᛠnce for her
ye sᛳn would have
If brave ye were
as my broᚦers of old
Or hard your hᛠrts
as ᚦe Huniᛲ kiᛝs
4
ᚦen Hamᚦer spake
ᚦe high of hᛠrt
Litle ᚦe ded
of Hogni didᛥ love
When Sigurᚦ ᚦey wakened
from his slep
ᚦy bedcovers white
were red wiᚦ blᛳd
Of ᚦy husband drenched
wiᚦ gore from his hᛠrt
5
Blᛳdy reveᛝe
didᛥ have for ᚦy broᚦers
Evil and sore
when ᚦy sons didᛥ slay
Else yet might we al
on Jormunrek
Togeᚦer our siᛥers
slayiᛝ aveᛝe
6
ᚦe gᛠr of ᚦe Huniᛲ
kiᛝs now give us
ᚦou haᛥ wheted us so
to ᚦe batle of swords
7
Laughiᛝ did Guᚦrun
go to her chamber
ᚦe helms of ᚦe kiᛝs
from ᚦe cupboards ᛲe tᛳk
And mailcoats broad
to her sons ᛲe bore ᚦem
On ᚦeir horses backs
ᚦe herᛟs lᛠped
8
ᚦen Hamᚦer spake
ᚦe high of hᛠrt
Homeward no more
his moᚦer to se
Comes ᚦe spᛠrgod
falen mid Goᚦic folk
One dᛠᚦdraught ᚦou
for us al ᛲalt drink
For Svanhild ᚦen
and ᚦy sons as wel
9
Wepiᛝ Guᚦrun
Gjukis daughter
Went sadly before
ᚦe gate to sit
And wiᚦ tᛠrᛥained cheks
to tel ᚦe tale
Of her mighty griefs
so many in kind
10
ᚦre homefires knew I
ᚦre hᛠrᚦs I knew
Home was I brought
by husbands ᚦre
But Sigurᚦ only
of al was dᛠr
He whom my broᚦers
brought to his dᛠᚦ
1
A grᛠter sorow
I saw not nor knew
Yet more it semed
I muᛥ sufer yet
When ᚦe princes grᛠt
to Atli gave me
12
ᚦe brave boys I sumoned
to secret spech
For my wᛟs requital
I might not win
Til of ᚦe hᛠds
of ᚦe Hnifluᛝs I hewed
13
To ᚦe sᛠ I went
my hᛠrt ful sore
For ᚦe Norns whose wraᚦ
I would now escape
But ᚦe lofty bilows
bore me undrowned
Til to land I came
so I loᛝer muᛥ live
14
ᚦen to ᚦe bed
of old was it beter
Of a kiᛝ of ᚦe folk
a ᚦird time I came
Boys I bore
his heirs to be
Heirs so youᛝ
ᚦe sons of Jonak
15
But round Svanhild
handmaidens sat
ᛲe was dᛠreᛥ ever
of al my children
So did Svanhild
sem in my hal
As ᚦe ray of ᚦe sun
is fair to se
16
Gold I gave her
and garments bright
Ere I let her go
to ᚦe Goᚦic folk
Of my hᛠvy wᛟs
ᚦe hardeᛥ it was
When Svanhilds treses
fair were troden
In ᚦe mire by hᛳfs
of horses wild
17
ᚦe soreᛥ it was
when Sigurᚦ mine
On his couch of victory
robed ᚦey kiled
And grimeᛥ of al
when to Gunars hᛠrt
ᚦere crept ᚦe brighᚦued
crawliᛝ snakes
18
And keneᛥ of al
when ᚦey cut ᚦe hᛠrt
From ᚦe liviᛝ brᛠᛥ
of ᚦe kiᛝ so brave
Many wᛟs I remember
19
Bridle Sigurᚦ
ᚦy ᛥed so black
Hiᚦer let run
ᚦy swiftfariᛝ horse
Here ᚦere sits not
son or daughter
Who yet to Guᚦrun
gifts ᛲal give
20
Remember Sigurᚦ
what once we said
When togeᚦer boᚦ
on ᚦe bed we sat
ᚦat mightily ᚦou
to me wouldᛥ come
From hel and I
from ᛠrᚦ to ᚦe
21
Pile ye up jarls
ᚦe pyre of oak
Make it ᚦe higheᛥ
a hero er had
Let ᚦe fire burn
my griefiled brᛠᛥ
My sorepresed hᛠrt
til my sorows melt
2
May nobles al
les sorow know
And les ᚦe wᛟs
of women become
Since ᚦe tale of ᚦis
lament is told
