Guthrun went forth to the sea after she had slain Atli She went out into the sea and fain would drown herself 
but she could not sink 
The waves bore her across the fjord to the land of King Jonak 
he took her as wife 
their sons were Sorli and Erp and Hamther 
There was brought up Svanhild Sigurths daughter 
she was married to the mighty Jormunrek 
With him was Bikki 
who counselled that Randver the kings son should have her 
This Bikki told to the king 
The king had Randver hanged and Svanhild trodden to death under horses feet 
And when Guthrun learned this she spake with her sons 
1
A wordstrife I learned 
most woeful of all
A speech from the fullness 
of sorrow spoken
When fierce of heart 
her sons to the fight
Did Guthrun whet 
with words full grim 
2
Why sit ye idle 
why sleep out your lives
Why grieve ye not 
in gladness to speak
Since Jormunrek 
your sister young
Beneath the hoofs 
of horses hath trodden
White and black 
on the battleway
Gray roadwonted 
the steeds of the Goths 
3
Not like are ye 
to Gunnar of yore
Nor have ye hearts 
such as Hognis was
Vengeance for her 
ye soon would have
If brave ye were 
as my brothers of old
Or hard your hearts 
as the Hunnish kings 
4
Then Hamther spake 
the high of heart
Little the deed 
of Hogni didst love
When Sigurth they wakened 
from his sleep
Thy bedcovers white 
were red with blood
Of thy husband drenched 
with gore from his heart 
5
Bloody revenge 
didst have for thy brothers
Evil and sore 
when thy sons didst slay
Else yet might we all 
on Jormunrek
Together our sisters 
slaying avenge 
6
The gear of the Hunnish 
kings now give us
Thou hast whetted us so 
to the battle of swords 
7
Laughing did Guthrun 
go to her chamber
The helms of the kings 
from the cupboards she took
And mailcoats broad 
to her sons she bore them
On their horses backs 
the heroes leaped 
8
Then Hamther spake 
the high of heart
Homeward no more 
his mother to see
Comes the speargod 
fallen mid Gothic folk
One deathdraught thou 
for us all shalt drink
For Svanhild then 
and thy sons as well 
9
Weeping Guthrun 
Gjukis daughter
Went sadly before 
the gate to sit
And with tearstained cheeks 
to tell the tale
Of her mighty griefs 
so many in kind 
10
Three homefires knew I 
three hearths I knew
Home was I brought 
by husbands three
But Sigurth only 
of all was dear
He whom my brothers 
brought to his death 
11
A greater sorrow 
I saw not nor knew
Yet more it seemed 
I must suffer yet
When the princes great 
to Atli gave me 
12
The brave boys I summoned 
to secret speech
For my woes requital 
I might not win
Till off the heads 
of the Hniflungs I hewed 
13
To the sea I went 
my heart full sore
For the Norns whose wrath 
I would now escape
But the lofty billows 
bore me undrowned
Till to land I came 
so I longer must live 
14
Then to the bed 
of old was it better
Of a king of the folk 
a third time I came
Boys I bore 
his heirs to be
Heirs so young 
the sons of Jonak 
15
But round Svanhild 
handmaidens sat
She was dearest ever 
of all my children
So did Svanhild 
seem in my hall
As the ray of the sun 
is fair to see 
16
Gold I gave her 
and garments bright
Ere I let her go 
to the Gothic folk
Of my heavy woes 
the hardest it was
When Svanhilds tresses 
fair were trodden
In the mire by hoofs 
of horses wild 
17
The sorest it was 
when Sigurth mine
On his couch of victory 
robbed they killed
And grimmest of all 
when to Gunnars heart
There crept the brighthued 
crawling snakes
18
And keenest of all 
when they cut the heart
From the living breast 
of the king so brave 
Many woes I remember 
19
Bridle Sigurth 
thy steed so black
Hither let run 
thy swiftfaring horse
Here there sits not 
son or daughter
Who yet to Guthrun 
gifts shall give 
20
Remember Sigurth 
what once we said
When together both 
on the bed we sat
That mightily thou 
to me wouldst come
From hell and I 
from earth to thee 
21
Pile ye up jarls 
the pyre of oak
Make it the highest 
a hero eer had
Let the fire burn 
my grieffilled breast
My sorepressed heart 
till my sorrows melt 
22
May nobles all 
less sorrow know
And less the woes 
of women become
Since the tale of this 
lament is told
