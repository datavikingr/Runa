Guᚦrun went forᚦ to ᚦe sᛠ after ᛲe had slain Atli ᛲe went out into ᚦe sᛠ and fain would drown herself
but ᛲe could not sink
ᚦe waves bore her across ᚦe fjord to ᚦe land of Kiᛝ Jonak
he tᛳk her as wife
ᚦeir sons were Sorli and Erp and Hamᚦer
ᚦere was brought up Svanhild Sigurᚦs daughter
ᛲe was married to ᚦe mighty Jormunrek
Wiᚦ him was Bikki
who counselled ᚦat Randver ᚦe kiᛝs son ᛲould have her
ᚦis Bikki told to ᚦe kiᛝ
ᚦe kiᛝ had Randver haᛝed and Svanhild trodden to dᛠᚦ under horses feet
And when Guᚦrun lᛠrned ᚦis ᛲe spake wiᚦ her sons
1
A wordᛥrife I lᛠrned
moᛥ wᛟful of all
A speech from ᚦe fullness
of sorrow spoken
When fierce of hᛠrt
her sons to ᚦe fight
Did Guᚦrun whet
wiᚦ words full grim
2
Why sit ye idle
why sleep out your lives
Why grieve ye not
in gladness to spᛠk
Since Jormunrek
your siᛥer youᛝ
Benᛠᚦ ᚦe hᛳfs
of horses haᚦ trodden
White and black
on ᚦe battleway
Gray roadwonted
ᚦe ᛥeeds of ᚦe Goᚦs
3
Not like are ye
to Gunnar of yore
Nor have ye hᛠrts
such as Hognis was
Veᛝᛠnce for her
ye sᛳn would have
If brave ye were
as my broᚦers of old
Or hard your hᛠrts
as ᚦe Hunniᛲ kiᛝs
4
ᚦen Hamᚦer spake
ᚦe high of hᛠrt
Little ᚦe deed
of Hogni didᛥ love
When Sigurᚦ ᚦey wakened
from his sleep
ᚦy bedcovers white
were red wiᚦ blᛳd
Of ᚦy husband drenched
wiᚦ gore from his hᛠrt
5
Blᛳdy reveᛝe
didᛥ have for ᚦy broᚦers
Evil and sore
when ᚦy sons didᛥ slay
Else yet might we all
on Jormunrek
Togeᚦer our siᛥers
slayiᛝ aveᛝe
6
ᚦe gᛠr of ᚦe Hunniᛲ
kiᛝs now give us
ᚦou haᛥ whetted us so
to ᚦe battle of swords
7
Laughiᛝ did Guᚦrun
go to her chamber
ᚦe helms of ᚦe kiᛝs
from ᚦe cupboards ᛲe tᛳk
And mailcoats broad
to her sons ᛲe bore ᚦem
On ᚦeir horses backs
ᚦe herᛟs lᛠped
8
ᚦen Hamᚦer spake
ᚦe high of hᛠrt
Homeward no more
his moᚦer to see
Comes ᚦe spᛠrgod
fallen mid Goᚦic folk
One dᛠᚦdraught ᚦou
for us all ᛲalt drink
For Svanhild ᚦen
and ᚦy sons as well
9
Weepiᛝ Guᚦrun
Gjukis daughter
Went sadly before
ᚦe gate to sit
And wiᚦ tᛠrᛥained cheeks
to tell ᚦe tale
Of her mighty griefs
so many in kind
10
ᚦree homefires knew I
ᚦree hᛠrᚦs I knew
Home was I brought
by husbands ᚦree
But Sigurᚦ only
of all was dᛠr
He whom my broᚦers
brought to his dᛠᚦ
11
A grᛠter sorrow
I saw not nor knew
Yet more it seemed
I muᛥ suffer yet
When ᚦe princes grᛠt
to Atli gave me
12
ᚦe brave boys I summoned
to secret speech
For my wᛟs requital
I might not win
Till off ᚦe hᛠds
of ᚦe Hnifluᛝs I hewed
13
To ᚦe sᛠ I went
my hᛠrt full sore
For ᚦe Norns whose wraᚦ
I would now escape
But ᚦe lofty billows
bore me undrowned
Till to land I came
so I loᛝer muᛥ live
14
ᚦen to ᚦe bed
of old was it better
Of a kiᛝ of ᚦe folk
a ᚦird time I came
Boys I bore
his heirs to be
Heirs so youᛝ
ᚦe sons of Jonak
15
But round Svanhild
handmaidens sat
ᛲe was dᛠreᛥ ever
of all my children
So did Svanhild
seem in my hall
As ᚦe ray of ᚦe sun
is fair to see
16
Gold I gave her
and garments bright
Ere I let her go
to ᚦe Goᚦic folk
Of my hᛠvy wᛟs
ᚦe hardeᛥ it was
When Svanhilds tresses
fair were trodden
In ᚦe mire by hᛳfs
of horses wild
17
ᚦe soreᛥ it was
when Sigurᚦ mine
On his couch of victory
robbed ᚦey killed
And grimmeᛥ of all
when to Gunnars hᛠrt
ᚦere crept ᚦe brighᚦued
crawliᛝ snakes
18
And keeneᛥ of all
when ᚦey cut ᚦe hᛠrt
From ᚦe liviᛝ brᛠᛥ
of ᚦe kiᛝ so brave
Many wᛟs I remember
19
Bridle Sigurᚦ
ᚦy ᛥeed so black
Hiᚦer let run
ᚦy swiftfariᛝ horse
Here ᚦere sits not
son or daughter
Who yet to Guᚦrun
gifts ᛲall give
20
Remember Sigurᚦ
what once we said
When togeᚦer boᚦ
on ᚦe bed we sat
ᚦat mightily ᚦou
to me wouldᛥ come
From hell and I
from ᛠrᚦ to ᚦee
21
Pile ye up jarls
ᚦe pyre of oak
Make it ᚦe higheᛥ
a hero eer had
Let ᚦe fire burn
my grieffilled brᛠᛥ
My sorepressed hᛠrt
till my sorrows melt
22
May nobles all
less sorrow know
And less ᚦe wᛟs
of women become
Since ᚦe tale of ᚦis
lament is told
