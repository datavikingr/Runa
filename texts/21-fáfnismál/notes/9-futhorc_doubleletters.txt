Sigurᚦ and Regin went up to ᚦe Gnitaheiᚦ and found ᚦere ᚦe track ᚦat Fafnir made when he crawled to water
ᚦen Sigurᚦ made a grᛠt trench acros ᚦe paᚦ and tᛳk his place ᚦerein
When Fafnir crawled from his gold he blew out venom and it ran down from above on Sigurᚦs hᛠd
But when Fafnir crawled over ᚦe trench ᚦen Sigurᚦ ᚦruᛥ his sword into his body to ᚦe hᛠrt
Fafnir wriᚦed and ᛥruck out wiᚦ his hᛠd and tail
Sigurᚦ lᛠped from ᚦe trench and ᛠch lᛳked at ᚦe oᚦer
Fafnir said
1
Youᚦ oh youᚦ
of whom ᚦen youᚦ art ᚦou born
Say whose son ᚦou art
Who in Fafnirs blᛳd
ᚦy bright blade redened
And ᛥruck ᚦy sword to my hᛠrt
Sigurᚦ concᛠled his name because it was believed in olden times ᚦat ᚦe word of a dyiᛝ man might have grᛠt power if he cursed his fᛟ by his name
He said
2
ᚦe Noble Hart
my name and I go
A moᚦerles man abroad
Faᚦer I had not
as oᚦers have
And lonely ever I live
Fafnir spake
3
If faᚦer ᚦou hadᛥ not
as oᚦers have
By what wonder waᛥ ᚦou born
ᚦough ᚦy name on ᚦe day
of my dᛠᚦ ᚦou hideᛥ
ᚦou knoweᛥ now ᚦou doᛥ lie
Sigurᚦ spake
4
My race meᚦinks
is unknown to ᚦe
And so am I myself
Sigurᚦ my name
and Sigmunds son
Who smote ᚦe ᚦus wiᚦ ᚦe sword
Fafnir spake
5
Who drove ᚦe on
why wert ᚦou driven
My life to make me lose
A faᚦer brave
had ᚦe brighteyed youᚦ
For bold in boyhᛳd ᚦou art
Sigurᚦ spake
6
My hᛠrt did drive me
my hand fulfiled
And my ᛲiniᛝ sword so ᛲarp
Few are ken
when old age comes
Who timid in boyhᛳd be
Fafnir spake
7
If ᚦou mighteᛥ grow
ᚦy friends amoᛝ
One might se ᚦe fiercely fight
But bound ᚦou art
and in batle taken
And to fᛠr are prisoners prone
Sigurᚦ spake
8
ᚦou blameᛥ me Fafnir
ᚦat I se from afar
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ ᚦat my faᚦers was
Not bound am I
ᚦough in batle taken
ᚦou haᛥ found ᚦat fre I live
Fafnir spake
9
In al I say
doᛥ ᚦou hatred se
Yet truᚦ alone do I tel
ᚦe soundiᛝ gold
ᚦe glowred wᛠlᚦ
And ᚦe riᛝs ᚦy bane ᛲal be
Sigurᚦ spake
10
Some one ᚦe hoard
ᛲal ever hold
Til ᚦe deᛥined day ᛲal come
For a time ᚦere is
when every man
ᛲal journey hence to hel
Fafnir spake
1
ᚦe fate of ᚦe Norns

ᚦou findeᛥ and dᛳm of a fᛳl
In ᚦe water ᛲalt drown
if ᚦou row gainᛥ ᚦe wind
Al daᛝer is nᛠr to dᛠᚦ
Sigurᚦ spake
12
Tel me ᚦen Fafnir
for wise ᚦou art famed
And much ᚦou knoweᛥ now
Who are ᚦe Norns
who are helpful in ned
And ᚦe babe from ᚦe moᚦer briᛝ
Fafnir spake
13
Of many birᚦs
ᚦe Norns muᛥ be
Nor one in race ᚦey were
Some to gods oᚦers
to elves are kin
And Dvalins daughters some
Sigurᚦ spake
14
Tel me ᚦen Fafnir
for wise ᚦou art famed
And much ᚦou knoweᛥ now
How cal ᚦey ᚦe isle
where al ᚦe gods
And Surt ᛲal swordswᛠt miᛝle
Fafnir spake
15
Oskopnir is it
where al ᚦe gods
ᛲal sek ᚦe play of swords
Bilroᛥ brᛠks
when ᚦey cros ᚦe bridge
And ᚦe ᛥeds ᛲal swim in ᚦe flᛳd
16
ᚦe fᛠrhelm I wore
to afright mankind
While guardiᛝ my gold I lay
Mightier semed I
ᚦan any man
For a fiercer never I found
Sigurᚦ spake
17
ᚦe fᛠrhelm surely
no man ᛲields
When he faces a valiant fᛟ
Oft one finds
when ᚦe fᛟ he mets
ᚦat he is not ᚦe braveᛥ of al
Fafnir spake
18
Venom I brᛠᚦed
when bright I lay
By ᚦe hoard my faᚦer had
ᚦere was none so mighty
as dared to met me
And wᛠpons nor wiles I fᛠred
Sigurᚦ spake
19
Gliteriᛝ worm
ᚦy hisiᛝ was grᛠt
And hard didᛥ ᛲow ᚦy hᛠrt
But hatred more
have ᚦe sons of men
For him who owns ᚦe helm
Fafnir spake
20
I counsel ᚦe Sigurᚦ
hed my spech
And ride ᚦou homeward hence
ᚦe soundiᛝ gold
ᚦe glowred wᛠlᚦ
And ᚦe riᛝs ᚦy bane ᛲal be
Sigurᚦ spake
21
ᚦy counsel is given
but go I ᛲal
To ᚦe gold in ᚦe hᛠᚦer hiden
And Fafnir ᚦou
wiᚦ dᛠᚦ doᛥ fight
Lyiᛝ where Hel ᛲal have ᚦe
Fafnir spake
2
Regin betrayed me
and ᚦe wil betray
Us boᚦ to dᛠᚦ wil he briᛝ
His life meᚦinks
muᛥ Fafnir lose
For ᚦe mightier man waᛥ ᚦou
Regin had gone to a diᛥance while Sigurᚦ fought Fafnir and came back while Sigurᚦ was wipiᛝ ᚦe blᛳd from his sword
Regin said
23
Hail to ᚦe Sigurᚦ
ᚦou victory haᛥ
And Fafnir in fight haᛥ slain
Of al ᚦe men
who trᛠd ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
Moᛥ fᛠrles art ᚦou meᚦinks
Sigurᚦ spake
24
Unknown it is
when al are togeᚦer
ᚦe sons of ᚦe glorious gods
Who braveᛥ born ᛲal sem
Some are valiant
who reden no sword
In ᚦe blᛳd of a fᛟmans brᛠᛥ
Regin spake
25
Glad art ᚦou Sigurᚦ
of batle gained
As Gram wiᚦ gras ᚦou clᛠnseᛥ
My broᚦer fierce
in fight haᛥ slain
And somewhat I did myself
Sigurᚦ spake
26
Afar didᛥ ᚦou go
while Fafnir redened
Wiᚦ his blᛳd my blade so ken
Wiᚦ ᚦe might of ᚦe dragon
my ᛥreᛝᚦ I matched
While ᚦou in ᚦe hᛠᚦer didᛥ hide
Regin spake
27
Loᛝer wouldᛥ ᚦou
in ᚦe hᛠᚦer have let
Yon hoary giant hide
Had ᚦe wᛠpon availed not
ᚦat once I forged
ᚦe kenedged blade ᚦou didᛥ bᛠr
Sigurᚦ spake
28
Beter is hᛠrt
ᚦan a mighty blade
For him who ᛲal fiercely fight
ᚦe brave man wel
ᛲal fight and win
ᚦough dul his blade may be
29
Brave men beter
ᚦan cowards be
When ᚦe claᛲ of batle comes
And beter ᚦe glad
ᚦan ᚦe glᛳmy man
ᛲal face what before him lies
30
ᚦy rede it was
ᚦat I ᛲould ride
Hiᚦer ᛟr mountains high
ᚦe gliteriᛝ worm
would have wᛠlᚦ and life
If ᚦou hadᛥ not mocked at my might
ᚦen Regin went up to Fafnir and cut out his hᛠrt wiᚦ his sword ᚦat was named Riᚦil and ᚦen he drank blᛳd from ᚦe wounds
Regin said
31
Sit now Sigurᚦ
for slep wil I
Hold Fafnirs hᛠrt to ᚦe fire
For al his hᛠrt
ᛲal ᛠten be
Since dep of blᛳd I have drunk
Sigurᚦ tᛳk Fafnirs hᛠrt and cᛳked it on a spit
When he ᚦought ᚦat it was fuly cᛳked and ᚦe blᛳd foamed out of ᚦe hᛠrt ᚦen he tried it wiᚦ his fiᛝer to se wheᚦer it was fuly cᛳked
He burned his fiᛝer and put it in his mouᚦ
But when Fafnirs hᛠrtsblᛳd came on his toᛝue he underᛥᛳd ᚦe spech of birds
He hᛠrd nuᚦatches chateriᛝ in ᚦe ᚦickets
A nuᚦatch said
32
ᚦere sits Sigurᚦ

And Fafnirs hᛠrt

Wise were ᚦe brᛠker

Til his broᚦer ᚦe maker

A ᚦird spake
34
Les by a hᛠd

Go from here to hel
ᚦen al of ᚦe wᛠlᚦ

ᚦe gold ᚦat Fafnir guarded
A fourᚦ spake
35
Wise would he sem

A fifᚦ spake

And let him of riᛝs be robed
ᚦen al ᚦe wᛠlᚦ

Sigurᚦ spake
39
Not so rich a fate

For sᛳn ᚦe broᚦers

And hence to hel ᛲal go
Sigurᚦ hewed of Regins hᛠd and ᚦen he ate Fafnirs hᛠrt and drank ᚦe blᛳd of boᚦ Regin and Fafnir
ᚦen Sigurᚦ hᛠrd what ᚦe nuᚦatch said
40
Bind Sigurᚦ ᚦe golden

Rich in gold
