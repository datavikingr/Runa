Sigurᚦ and Regin went up to ᚦe Gnitaheiᚦ and found ᚦere ᚦe track ᚦat Fafnir made when he crawled to water
ᚦen Sigurᚦ made a grᛠt trench across ᚦe paᚦ and tᛳk his place ᚦerein
When Fafnir crawled from his gold he blew out venom and it ran down from above on Sigurᚦs hᛠd
But when Fafnir crawled over ᚦe trench ᚦen Sigurᚦ ᚦruᛥ his sword into his body to ᚦe hᛠrt
Fafnir wriᚦed and ᛥruck out wiᚦ his hᛠd and tail
Sigurᚦ lᛠped from ᚦe trench and ᛠch lᛳked at ᚦe oᚦer
Fafnir said
1
Youᚦ oh youᚦ
of whom ᚦen youᚦ art ᚦou born
Say whose son ᚦou art
Who in Fafnirs blᛳd
ᚦy bright blade reddened
And ᛥruck ᚦy sword to my hᛠrt
Sigurᚦ concᛠled his name because it was believed in olden times ᚦat ᚦe word of a dyiᛝ man might have grᛠt power if he cursed his fᛟ by his name
He said
2
ᚦe Noble Hart
my name and I go
A moᚦerless man abroad
Faᚦer I had not
as oᚦers have
And lonely ever I live
Fafnir spake
3
If faᚦer ᚦou hadᛥ not
as oᚦers have
By what wonder waᛥ ᚦou born
ᚦough ᚦy name on ᚦe day
of my dᛠᚦ ᚦou hideᛥ
ᚦou knoweᛥ now ᚦou doᛥ lie
Sigurᚦ spake
4
My race meᚦinks
is unknown to ᚦee
And so am I myself
Sigurᚦ my name
and Sigmunds son
Who smote ᚦee ᚦus wiᚦ ᚦe sword
Fafnir spake
5
Who drove ᚦee on
why wert ᚦou driven
My life to make me lose
A faᚦer brave
had ᚦe brighteyed youᚦ
For bold in boyhᛳd ᚦou art
Sigurᚦ spake
6
My hᛠrt did drive me
my hand fulfilled
And my ᛲiniᛝ sword so ᛲarp
Few are keen
when old age comes
Who timid in boyhᛳd be
Fafnir spake
7
If ᚦou mighteᛥ grow
ᚦy friends amoᛝ
One might see ᚦee fiercely fight
But bound ᚦou art
and in battle taken
And to fᛠr are prisoners prone
Sigurᚦ spake
8
ᚦou blameᛥ me Fafnir
ᚦat I see from afar
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ ᚦat my faᚦers was
Not bound am I
ᚦough in battle taken
ᚦou haᛥ found ᚦat free I live
Fafnir spake
9
In all I say
doᛥ ᚦou hatred see
Yet truᚦ alone do I tell
ᚦe soundiᛝ gold
ᚦe glowred wᛠlᚦ
And ᚦe riᛝs ᚦy bane ᛲall be
Sigurᚦ spake
10
Some one ᚦe hoard
ᛲall ever hold
Till ᚦe deᛥined day ᛲall come
For a time ᚦere is
when every man
ᛲall journey hence to hell
Fafnir spake
11
ᚦe fate of ᚦe Norns
before ᚦe hᛠdland
ᚦou findeᛥ and dᛳm of a fᛳl
In ᚦe water ᛲalt drown
if ᚦou row gainᛥ ᚦe wind
All daᛝer is nᛠr to dᛠᚦ
Sigurᚦ spake
12
Tell me ᚦen Fafnir
for wise ᚦou art famed
And much ᚦou knoweᛥ now
Who are ᚦe Norns
who are helpful in need
And ᚦe babe from ᚦe moᚦer briᛝ
Fafnir spake
13
Of many birᚦs
ᚦe Norns muᛥ be
Nor one in race ᚦey were
Some to gods oᚦers
to elves are kin
And Dvalins daughters some
Sigurᚦ spake
14
Tell me ᚦen Fafnir
for wise ᚦou art famed
And much ᚦou knoweᛥ now
How call ᚦey ᚦe isle
where all ᚦe gods
And Surt ᛲall swordswᛠt miᛝle
Fafnir spake
15
Oskopnir is it
where all ᚦe gods
ᛲall seek ᚦe play of swords
Bilroᛥ brᛠks
when ᚦey cross ᚦe bridge
And ᚦe ᛥeeds ᛲall swim in ᚦe flᛳd
16
ᚦe fᛠrhelm I wore
to afright mankind
While guardiᛝ my gold I lay
Mightier seemed I
ᚦan any man
For a fiercer never I found
Sigurᚦ spake
17
ᚦe fᛠrhelm surely
no man ᛲields
When he faces a valiant fᛟ
Oft one finds
when ᚦe fᛟ he meets
ᚦat he is not ᚦe braveᛥ of all
Fafnir spake
18
Venom I brᛠᚦed
when bright I lay
By ᚦe hoard my faᚦer had
ᚦere was none so mighty
as dared to meet me
And wᛠpons nor wiles I fᛠred
Sigurᚦ spake
19
Glitteriᛝ worm
ᚦy hissiᛝ was grᛠt
And hard didᛥ ᛲow ᚦy hᛠrt
But hatred more
have ᚦe sons of men
For him who owns ᚦe helm
Fafnir spake
20
I counsel ᚦee Sigurᚦ
heed my speech
And ride ᚦou homeward hence
ᚦe soundiᛝ gold
ᚦe glowred wᛠlᚦ
And ᚦe riᛝs ᚦy bane ᛲall be
Sigurᚦ spake
21
ᚦy counsel is given
but go I ᛲall
To ᚦe gold in ᚦe hᛠᚦer hidden
And Fafnir ᚦou
wiᚦ dᛠᚦ doᛥ fight
Lyiᛝ where Hel ᛲall have ᚦee
Fafnir spake
22
Regin betrayed me
and ᚦee will betray
Us boᚦ to dᛠᚦ will he briᛝ
His life meᚦinks
muᛥ Fafnir lose
For ᚦe mightier man waᛥ ᚦou
Regin had gone to a diᛥance while Sigurᚦ fought Fafnir and came back while Sigurᚦ was wipiᛝ ᚦe blᛳd from his sword
Regin said
23
Hail to ᚦee Sigurᚦ
ᚦou victory haᛥ
And Fafnir in fight haᛥ slain
Of all ᚦe men
who trᛠd ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
Moᛥ fᛠrless art ᚦou meᚦinks
Sigurᚦ spake
24
Unknown it is
when all are togeᚦer
ᚦe sons of ᚦe glorious gods
Who braveᛥ born ᛲall seem
Some are valiant
who redden no sword
In ᚦe blᛳd of a fᛟmans brᛠᛥ
Regin spake
25
Glad art ᚦou Sigurᚦ
of battle gained
As Gram wiᚦ grass ᚦou clᛠnseᛥ
My broᚦer fierce
in fight haᛥ slain
And somewhat I did myself
Sigurᚦ spake
26
Afar didᛥ ᚦou go
while Fafnir reddened
Wiᚦ his blᛳd my blade so keen
Wiᚦ ᚦe might of ᚦe dragon
my ᛥreᛝᚦ I matched
While ᚦou in ᚦe hᛠᚦer didᛥ hide
Regin spake
27
Loᛝer wouldᛥ ᚦou
in ᚦe hᛠᚦer have let
Yon hoary giant hide
Had ᚦe wᛠpon availed not
ᚦat once I forged
ᚦe keenedged blade ᚦou didᛥ bᛠr
Sigurᚦ spake
28
Better is hᛠrt
ᚦan a mighty blade
For him who ᛲall fiercely fight
ᚦe brave man well
ᛲall fight and win
ᚦough dull his blade may be
29
Brave men better
ᚦan cowards be
When ᚦe claᛲ of battle comes
And better ᚦe glad
ᚦan ᚦe glᛳmy man
ᛲall face what before him lies
30
ᚦy rede it was
ᚦat I ᛲould ride
Hiᚦer ᛟr mountains high
ᚦe glitteriᛝ worm
would have wᛠlᚦ and life
If ᚦou hadᛥ not mocked at my might
ᚦen Regin went up to Fafnir and cut out his hᛠrt wiᚦ his sword ᚦat was named Riᚦil and ᚦen he drank blᛳd from ᚦe wounds
Regin said
31
Sit now Sigurᚦ
for sleep will I
Hold Fafnirs hᛠrt to ᚦe fire
For all his hᛠrt
ᛲall ᛠten be
Since deep of blᛳd I have drunk
Sigurᚦ tᛳk Fafnirs hᛠrt and cᛳked it on a spit
When he ᚦought ᚦat it was fully cᛳked and ᚦe blᛳd foamed out of ᚦe hᛠrt ᚦen he tried it wiᚦ his fiᛝer to see wheᚦer it was fully cᛳked
He burned his fiᛝer and put it in his mouᚦ
But when Fafnirs hᛠrtsblᛳd came on his toᛝue he underᛥᛳd ᚦe speech of birds
He hᛠrd nuᚦatches chatteriᛝ in ᚦe ᚦickets
A nuᚦatch said
32
ᚦere sits Sigurᚦ
sprinkled wiᚦ blᛳd
And Fafnirs hᛠrt
wiᚦ fire he cᛳks
Wise were ᚦe brᛠker
of riᛝs I ween
To ᛠt ᚦe lifemuscles
all so bright
A second spake
33
ᚦere Regin lies
and plans he lays
ᚦe youᚦ to betray
who truᛥs him well
Lyiᛝ words
wiᚦ wiles will he spᛠk
Till his broᚦer ᚦe maker
of mischief aveᛝes
A ᚦird spake
34
Less by a hᛠd
let ᚦe chatterer hoary
Go from here to hell
ᚦen all of ᚦe wᛠlᚦ
he alone can wield
ᚦe gold ᚦat Fafnir guarded
A fourᚦ spake
35
Wise would he seem
if so he would heed
ᚦe counsel gᛳd
we siᛥers give
ᚦought he would give
and ᚦe ravens gladden
ᚦere is ever a wolf
where his ᛠrs I spy
A fifᚦ spake
36
Less wise muᛥ be
ᚦe tree of battle
ᚦan to me would seem
ᚦe lᛠder of men
If forᚦ he lets
one broᚦer fare
When he of ᚦe oᚦer
ᚦe slayer is
A sixᚦ spake
37
Moᛥ fᛳliᛲ he seems
if he ᛲall spare
His fᛟ ᚦe bane of ᚦe folk
ᚦere Regin lies
who haᚦ wroᛝed him so
Yet falsehᛳd knows he not
A sevenᚦ spake
38 Let ᚦe hᛠd from ᚦe froᛥcold
giant be hewed
And let him of riᛝs be robbed
ᚦen all ᚦe wᛠlᚦ
which Fafnirs was
ᛲall beloᛝ to ᚦee alone
Sigurᚦ spake
39
Not so rich a fate
ᛲall Regin have
As ᚦe tale of my dᛠᚦ to tell
For sᛳn ᚦe broᚦers
boᚦ ᛲall die
And hence to hell ᛲall go
Sigurᚦ hewed off Regins hᛠd and ᚦen he ate Fafnirs hᛠrt and drank ᚦe blᛳd of boᚦ Regin and Fafnir
ᚦen Sigurᚦ hᛠrd what ᚦe nuᚦatch said
40
Bind Sigurᚦ ᚦe golden
riᛝs togeᚦer
Not kiᛝly is it
aught to fᛠr
I know a maid
ᚦere is none so fair
Rich in gold
if ᚦou mighteᛥ get her
41
Green ᚦe paᚦs
ᚦat to Gjuki lᛠd
And his fate ᚦe way
to ᚦe wanderer ᛲows
ᚦe doughty kiᛝ
a daughter has
ᚦat ᚦou as a bride
mayᛥ Sigurᚦ buy
Anoᚦer spake
42
A hall ᛥands high
on Hindarfjoll
All wiᚦ flame
is it riᛝed wiᚦout
Warriors wise
did make it once
Out of ᚦe flamiᛝ
light of ᚦe flᛳd
43
On ᚦe mountain sleeps
a battlemaid
And about her plays
ᚦe bane of ᚦe wᛳd
Ygg wiᚦ ᚦe ᚦorn
haᚦ smitten her ᚦus
For ᛲe felled ᚦe fighter
he fain would save
44
ᚦere mayᛥ ᚦou behold
ᚦe maiden helmed
Who forᚦ on Viᛝskornir
rode from ᚦe fight
ᚦe victorybriᛝer
her sleep ᛲall brᛠk not
ᚦou herᛟs son
so ᚦe Norns have set
Sigurᚦ rode aloᛝ Fafnirs trail to his lair and found it open
ᚦe gatepoᛥs were of iron and ᚦe gates of iron tᛳ were all ᚦe bᛠms in ᚦe house which was dug down into ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
ᚦere Sigurᚦ found a mighty ᛥore of gold and he filled two cheᛥs full ᚦereof
he tᛳk ᚦe fᛠrhelm and a golden mailcoat and ᚦe sword Hrotti and many oᚦer precious ᚦiᛝs and loaded Grani wiᚦ ᚦem
but ᚦe horse would not go forward until Sigurᚦ mounted on his back
