Sigurᚦ went to Hjalpreks ᛥud and chose for himself a horse who ᚦerᛠfter was caled Grani
At ᚦat time Regin ᚦe son of Hreiᚦmar was come to Hjalpreks home
he was more iᛝenious ᚦan al oᚦer men and a dwarf in ᛥature
he was wise fierce and skiled in magic
Regin undertᛳk Sigurᚦs briᛝiᛝ up and tᛠchiᛝ and loved him much
He told Sigurᚦ of his forefaᚦers and also of ᚦis ᚦat once Oᚦin and Hönir and Loki had come to Andvaris waterfal
and in ᚦe fal were many fiᛲ
Andvari was a dwarf
who had dwelt loᛝ in ᚦe waterfal in ᚦe ᛲape of a pike and ᚦere he got his fᛳd
Otr was ᚦe name of a broᚦer of ours said Regin who often went into ᚦe fal in ᚦe ᛲape of an oter
he had caught a salmon and sat on ᚦe high bank ᛠtiᛝ it wiᚦ his eyes ᛲut
Loki ᚦrew a ᛥone at him and kiled him
ᚦe gods ᚦought ᚦey bad had grᛠt gᛳd luck and ᛥriped ᚦe skin of ᚦe oter
ᚦat same eveniᛝ ᚦey sought a nights lodgiᛝ at Hreiᚦmars house and ᛲowed ᚦeir bᛳty
ᚦen we seized ᚦem and told ᚦem as ransom for ᚦeir lives to fil ᚦe oter skin wiᚦ gold and completely cover it outside as wel wiᚦ red gold
ᚦen ᚦey sent Loki to get ᚦe gold
he went to Ron and got her net and went ᚦen to Andvaris fal and caᛥ ᚦe net in front of ᚦe pike and ᚦe pike lᛠped into ᚦe net
ᚦen Loki said
1
What is ᚦe fiᛲ
ᚦat runs in ᚦe flᛳd
And itself from il canot save
If ᚦy hᛠd ᚦou wouldᛥ
from hel redem
Find me ᚦe waters flame
Andvari spake
2
Andvari am I
and Oin my faᚦer
In many a fal have I fared
An evil Norn
in olden days
Dᛳmed me in waters to dwel
Loki spake
3
Andvari say
if ᚦou sekeᛥ ᛥil
To live in ᚦe land of men
What payment is set
for ᚦe sons of men
Who war wiᚦ lyiᛝ words
Andvari spake
4
A mighty payment
ᚦe men muᛥ make
Who in Vaᚦgelmirs waters wade
On a loᛝ road lᛠd
ᚦe lyiᛝ words
ᚦat one to anoᚦer uters
Loki saw al ᚦe gold ᚦat Andvari had
But when he had brought forᚦ al ᚦe gold he held back one riᛝ and Loki tᛳk ᚦis from him
ᚦe dwarf went into his rocky hole and said
5
Now ᛲal ᚦe gold
ᚦat Guᛥ once had
Briᛝ ᚦeir dᛠᚦ
to broᚦers twain
And evil be
for herᛟs eight
joy of my wᛠlᚦ
ᛲal no man win
ᚦe gods gave Hreiᚦmar ᚦe gold and filed up ᚦe oterskin and ᛥᛳd it on its fet
ᚦen ᚦe gods had to hᛠp up gold and hide it
And when ᚦat was done Hreiᚦmar came forward and saw a siᛝle whisker and bade ᚦem cover it
ᚦen Oᚦin brought out ᚦe riᛝ Andvaranaut and covered ᚦe hair
ᚦen Loki said
6
ᚦe gold is given
and grᛠt ᚦe price
ᚦou haᛥ my hᛠd to save
But fortune ᚦy sons
ᛲal find not ᚦere
ᚦe bane of ye boᚦ it is
Hreiᚦmar spake
7
Gifts ye gave
but ye gave not kindly
Gave not wiᚦ hᛠrts ᚦat were whole
Your lives ere ᚦis
ᛲould ye al have loᛥ
If sᛳner ᚦis fate I had sen
Loki spake
8
Worse is ᚦis
ᚦat meᚦinks I se
For a maid ᛲal kinsmen claᛲ
Herᛟs unborn

Hreiᚦmar spake
9

So loᛝ as I ᛲal live
Nought of fᛠr
for ᚦy ᚦrᛠts I fel
So get ye hence to your homes
Fafnir and Regin asked Hreiᚦmar for a ᛲare of ᚦe wᛠlᚦ ᚦat was paid for ᚦe slayiᛝ of ᚦeir broᚦer Otr
ᚦis he refused
and Fafnir ᚦruᛥ his sword ᚦrough ᚦe body of his faᚦer Hreiᚦmar while he was slepiᛝ
Hreiᚦmar caled to his daughters
10
Lyᛝheiᚦ and Lofnheiᚦ

And mighty now is my ned
Lyᛝheiᚦ spake
ᚦough a siᛥer loses
her faᚦer seldom
Reveᛝe on her broᚦer ᛲe briᛝs
Hreiᚦmar spake

ᚦen Hreiᚦmar died and Fafnir tᛳk al ᚦe gold
ᚦereupon Regin asked to have his inheritance from his faᚦer but Fafnir refused ᚦis
ᚦen Regin asked counsel of Lyᛝheiᚦ his siᛥer how he ᛲould win his inheritance
ᛲe said
12
In friendly wise

Of ᚦy broᚦer and beter wil
Not semly is it
to sek wiᚦ ᚦe sword
Fafnirs trᛠsure to take
Al ᚦese hapeniᛝs did Regin tel to Sigurᚦ
One day when he came to Regins house he was gladly welcomed
Regin said
13
Hiᚦer ᚦe son

Sigurᚦ was ᚦere continualy wiᚦ Regin who said to Sigurᚦ ᚦat Fafnir lay at Gnitaheiᚦ and was in ᚦe ᛲape of a dragon
He had a fᛠrhelm of which al liviᛝ crᛠtures were terified
Regin made Sigurᚦ ᚦe sword which was caled Gram

Wiᚦ ᚦis sword Sigurᚦ cleft asunder Regins anvil
After ᚦat Regin eged Sigurᚦ on to slay Fafnir
but he said
15
Loud wil ᚦe sons
of Hundiᛝ laugh

If ᚦe hero sᛳner

It is wel meᚦinks
