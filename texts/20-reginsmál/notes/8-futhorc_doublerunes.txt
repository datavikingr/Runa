Sigurᚦ went to Hjalpreks ᛥud and chose for himself a horse who ᚦerᛠfter was called Grani
At ᚦat time Regin ᚦe son of Hreiᚦmar was come to Hjalpreks home
he was more iᛝenious ᚦan all oᚦer men and a dwarf in ᛥature
he was wise fierce and skilled in magic
Regin undertᛳk Sigurᚦs briᛝiᛝ up and tᛠchiᛝ and loved him much
He told Sigurᚦ of his forefaᚦers and also of ᚦis ᚦat once Oᚦin and Hönir and Loki had come to Andvaris waterfall
and in ᚦe fall were many fiᛲ
Andvari was a dwarf
who had dwelt loᛝ in ᚦe waterfall in ᚦe ᛲape of a pike and ᚦere he got his fᛳd
Otr was ᚦe name of a broᚦer of ours said Regin who often went into ᚦe fall in ᚦe ᛲape of an otter
he had caught a salmon and sat on ᚦe high bank ᛠtiᛝ it wiᚦ his eyes ᛲut
Loki ᚦrew a ᛥone at him and killed him
ᚦe gods ᚦought ᚦey bad had grᛠt gᛳd luck and ᛥripped ᚦe skin off ᚦe otter
ᚦat same eveniᛝ ᚦey sought a nights lodgiᛝ at Hreiᚦmars house and ᛲowed ᚦeir bᛳty
ᚦen we seized ᚦem and told ᚦem as ransom for ᚦeir lives to fill ᚦe otter skin wiᚦ gold and completely cover it outside as well wiᚦ red gold
ᚦen ᚦey sent Loki to get ᚦe gold
he went to Ron and got her net and went ᚦen to Andvaris fall and caᛥ ᚦe net in front of ᚦe pike and ᚦe pike lᛠped into ᚦe net
ᚦen Loki said
1
What is ᚦe fiᛲ
ᚦat runs in ᚦe flᛳd
And itself from ill cannot save
If ᚦy hᛠd ᚦou wouldᛥ
from hell redeem
Find me ᚦe waters flame
Andvari spake
2
Andvari am I
and Oin my faᚦer
In many a fall have I fared
An evil Norn
in olden days
Dᛳmed me in waters to dwell
Loki spake
3
Andvari say
if ᚦou seekeᛥ ᛥill
To live in ᚦe land of men
What payment is set
for ᚦe sons of men
Who war wiᚦ lyiᛝ words
Andvari spake
4
A mighty payment
ᚦe men muᛥ make
Who in Vaᚦgelmirs waters wade
On a loᛝ road lᛠd
ᚦe lyiᛝ words
ᚦat one to anoᚦer utters
Loki saw all ᚦe gold ᚦat Andvari had
But when he had brought forᚦ all ᚦe gold he held back one riᛝ and Loki tᛳk ᚦis from him
ᚦe dwarf went into his rocky hole and said
5
Now ᛲall ᚦe gold
ᚦat Guᛥ once had
Briᛝ ᚦeir dᛠᚦ
to broᚦers twain
And evil be
for herᛟs eight
joy of my wᛠlᚦ
ᛲall no man win
ᚦe gods gave Hreiᚦmar ᚦe gold and filled up ᚦe otterskin and ᛥᛳd it on its feet
ᚦen ᚦe gods had to hᛠp up gold and hide it
And when ᚦat was done Hreiᚦmar came forward and saw a siᛝle whisker and bade ᚦem cover it
ᚦen Oᚦin brought out ᚦe riᛝ Andvaranaut and covered ᚦe hair
ᚦen Loki said
6
ᚦe gold is given
and grᛠt ᚦe price
ᚦou haᛥ my hᛠd to save
But fortune ᚦy sons
ᛲall find not ᚦere
ᚦe bane of ye boᚦ it is
Hreiᚦmar spake
7
Gifts ye gave
but ye gave not kindly
Gave not wiᚦ hᛠrts ᚦat were whole
Your lives ere ᚦis
ᛲould ye all have loᛥ
If sᛳner ᚦis fate I had seen
Loki spake
8
Worse is ᚦis
ᚦat meᚦinks I see
For a maid ᛲall kinsmen claᛲ
Herᛟs unborn
ᚦereby ᛲall be
I deem to hatred dᛳmed
Hreiᚦmar spake
9
ᚦe gold so red
ᛲall I rule meᚦinks
So loᛝ as I ᛲall live
Nought of fᛠr
for ᚦy ᚦrᛠts I feel
So get ye hence to your homes
Fafnir and Regin asked Hreiᚦmar for a ᛲare of ᚦe wᛠlᚦ ᚦat was paid for ᚦe slayiᛝ of ᚦeir broᚦer Otr
ᚦis he refused
and Fafnir ᚦruᛥ his sword ᚦrough ᚦe body of his faᚦer Hreiᚦmar while he was sleepiᛝ
Hreiᚦmar called to his daughters
10
Lyᛝheiᚦ and Lofnheiᚦ
fled is my life
And mighty now is my need
Lyᛝheiᚦ spake
ᚦough a siᛥer loses
her faᚦer seldom
Reveᛝe on her broᚦer ᛲe briᛝs
Hreiᚦmar spake
11
A daughter woman
wiᚦ wolfs hᛠrt bᛠr
If ᚦou haᛥ no son
wiᚦ ᚦe hero brave
If one weds ᚦe maid
for ᚦe need is mighty
ᚦeir son for ᚦy hurt
may veᛝᛠnce seek
ᚦen Hreiᚦmar died and Fafnir tᛳk all ᚦe gold
ᚦereupon Regin asked to have his inheritance from his faᚦer but Fafnir refused ᚦis
ᚦen Regin asked counsel of Lyᛝheiᚦ his siᛥer how he ᛲould win his inheritance
ᛲe said
12
In friendly wise
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ ᛲalt ᚦou ask
Of ᚦy broᚦer and better will
Not seemly is it
to seek wiᚦ ᚦe sword
Fafnirs trᛠsure to take
All ᚦese happeniᛝs did Regin tell to Sigurᚦ
One day when he came to Regins house he was gladly welcomed
Regin said
13
Hiᚦer ᚦe son
of Sigmund is come
ᚦe hero ᛠger
here to our hall
His courage is more
ᚦan an ancient mans
And battle I hope
from ᚦe hardy wolf
14
Here ᛲall I foᛥer
ᚦe fᛠrless prince
Now Yᛝvis heir
to us is come
ᚦe nobleᛥ hero
benᛠᚦ ᚦe sun
ᚦe ᚦrᛠds of his fate
all lands enfold
Sigurᚦ was ᚦere continually wiᚦ Regin who said to Sigurᚦ ᚦat Fafnir lay at Gnitaheiᚦ and was in ᚦe ᛲape of a dragon
He had a fᛠrhelm of which all liviᛝ crᛠtures were terrified
Regin made Sigurᚦ ᚦe sword which was called Gram
it was so ᛲarp ᚦat when he ᚦruᛥ it down into ᚦe Rhine and let a ᛥrand of wᛳl drift againᛥ it wiᚦ ᚦe ᛥrᛠm it cleft ᚦe ᛥrand asunder as if it were water
Wiᚦ ᚦis sword Sigurᚦ cleft asunder Regins anvil
After ᚦat Regin egged Sigurᚦ on to slay Fafnir
but he said
15
Loud will ᚦe sons
of Hundiᛝ laugh
Who low did Eylimi
lay in dᛠᚦ
If ᚦe hero sᛳner
seeks ᚦe red
Riᛝs to find
ᚦan his faᚦers veᛝᛠnce
Kiᛝ Hjalprek gave Sigurᚦ a fleet for ᚦe aveᛝiᛝ of his faᚦer
ᚦey ran into a grᛠt ᛥorm and were off a certain hᛠdland
A man ᛥᛳd on ᚦe mountain and said
16
Who yonder rides
on Rᚫvils ᛥeeds
ᛟr toweriᛝ waves
and waters wild
ᚦe sailhorses all
wiᚦ swᛠt are drippiᛝ
Nor can ᚦe sᛠᛥeeds

Regin answered
17
On ᚦe sᛠtrees here
are Sigurᚦ and I
ᚦe ᛥorm wind drives us
on to our dᛠᚦ
ᚦe waves craᛲ down
on ᚦe forward deck
And ᚦe rollerᛥeeds sink
who seeks our names
ᚦe Man spake
18
Hnikar I was
when Volsuᛝ once
Gladdened ᚦe ravens
and battle gave
Call me ᚦe Man
from ᚦe Mountain now
Feᛝ or Fjolnir
wiᚦ you will I fare
ᚦey sailed to ᚦe land and ᚦe man went on board ᚦe ᛲip and ᚦe ᛥorm subsided
Sigurᚦ spake
19
Hnikar say
for ᚦou seeᛥ ᚦe fate
ᚦat to gods and men is given
What sign is faireᛥ
for him who fights
And beᛥ for ᚦe swiᛝiᛝ of swords
Hnikar spake
20
Many ᚦe signs
if men but knew
ᚦat are gᛳd for ᚦe swiᛝiᛝ of swords
It is well meᚦinks
if ᚦe warrior meets
A raven black on his road
21
Anoᚦer it is
if out ᚦou art come
And art rᛠdy forᚦ to fare
To behold on ᚦe paᚦ
before ᚦy house
Two fighters greedy of fame
22
ᚦird it is well
if a howliᛝ wolf
ᚦou hᛠreᛥ under ᚦe aᛲ
And fortune comes
if ᚦy fᛟ ᚦou seeᛥ
Ere ᚦee ᚦe hero beholds
23
A man ᛲall fight not
when he muᛥ face
ᚦe mᛳns bright siᛥer settiᛝ late
Win he ᛲall
who well can see
And wedgelike forms
his men for ᚦe fray
24
Foul is ᚦe sign
if ᚦy fᛳt ᛲall ᛥumble
As ᚦou gᛟᛥ forᚦ to fight
Goddesses baneful
at boᚦ ᚦy sides
Will ᚦat wounds ᚦou ᛲalt get
25
Combed and waᛲed
ᛲall ᚦe wise man go
And a mᛠl at morn ᛲall take
For unknown it is
where at eve he may be
It is ill ᚦy luck to lose
Sigurᚦ had a grᛠt battle wiᚦ Lyᛝvi ᚦe son of Hundiᛝ and his broᚦers
ᚦere Lyᛝvi fell and his two broᚦers wiᚦ him
After ᚦe battle Regin said
26
Now ᚦe blᛳdy ᛠgle
wiᚦ bitiᛝ sword
Is carved on ᚦe back
of Sigmunds killer
Few were more fierce
in fight ᚦan his son
Who reddened ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
and gladdened ᚦe ravens
Sigurᚦ went home to Hjalpreks house
ᚦereupon Regin egged him on to fight wiᚦ Fafnir
