1.
In olden days, |
when eagles screamed,
And holy streams |
from heaven's crags fell,
Was Helgi then, |
the hero-hearted,
Borghild's son, |
in Bralund born. 

2.
‚Twas night in the dwelling, |
and Norns there came,
Who shaped the life |
of the lofty one;
They bade him most famed |
of fighters all
And best of princes |
ever to be. 

3.
Mightily wove they |
the web of fate,
While Bralund's towns |
were trembling all;
And there the golden |
threads they wove,
And in the moon's hall |
fast they made them. 

4.
East and west |
the ends they hid,
In the middle the hero |
should have his land;
And Neri's kinswoman |
northward cast
A chain, and bade it |
firm ever to be. 
5. Once sorrow had |
the Ylfings' son,
And grief the bride |
who the loved one had borne.
Quoth raven to raven, |
on treetop resting,
Seeking for food, |
"There is something I know. 

6.
"In mail-coat stands |
the son of Sigmund,
A half-day old; |
now day is here;
His eyes flash sharp |
as the heroes' are,
He is friend of the wolves; |
full glad are we." 

7.
The warrior throng |
a ruler thought him,
Good times, they said, |
mankind should see;
The king himself |
from battle-press came,
To give the prince |
a leek full proud. 

8.
Helgi he named him, |
and Hringstathir gave him,
Solfjoll, Snæfjoll, |
and Sigarsvoll,
Hringstoth, Hotun, |
and Himinvangar,
And a blood-snake bedecked |
to Sinfjotli's brother. 

9.
Mighty he grew |
in the midst of his friends,
The fair-born elm, |
in fortune's glow;
To his comrades gold |
he gladly gave,
The hero spared not |
the blood-flecked hoard. 

10.
Short time for war |
the chieftain waited,
When fifteen winters |
old he was;
Hunding he slew, |
the hardy wight
Who long had ruled |
o'er lands and men. 

11.
Of Sigmund's son |
then next they sought
Hoard and rings, |
the sons of Hunding;
They bade the prince |
requital pay
For booty stolen |
and father slain. 

12.
The prince let not |
their prayers avail,
Nor gold for their dead |
did the kinsmen get;
Waiting, he said, |
was a mighty storm
Of lances gray |
and Othin's grimness. 

13.
The warriors forth |
to the battle went,
The field they chose |
at Logafjoll;
Frothi's peace |
midst foes they broke,
Through the isle went hungrily |
Vithrir's hounds. 

14.
The king then sat, |
when he had slain
Eyjolf and Alf, |
'neath the eagle-stone;
Hjorvarth and Hovarth, |
Hunding's sons,
The kin of the spear-wielder, |
all had he killed. 

15.
Then glittered light |
from Logafjoll,
And from the light |
the flashes leaped;

16.
High under helms |
on heaven's field;
Their byrnies all |
with blood were red,
And from their spears |
the sparks flew forth. 

17.
Early then |
in wolf-wood asked
The mighty king |
of the southern maid,
If with the hero |
home would she
Come that night; |
the weapons clashed. 

18.
Down from her horse |
sprang Hogni's daughter,--
The shields were still,-- |
and spake to the hero:
"Other tasks |
are ours, methinks,
Than drinking beer |
with the breaker of rings. 

19.
"My father has pledged |
his daughter fair
As bride to Granmar's |
son so grim;
But, Helgi, I |
once Hothbrodd called
As fine a king |
as the son of a cat. 

20.
"Yet the hero will come |
a few nights hence,
Unless thou dost bid him |
the battle-ground seek,
Or takest the maid |
from the warrior mighty." 
Helgi spake:

21.
"Fear him not, |
though Isung he felled,
First must our courage |
keen be tried,
Before unwilling |
thou fare with the knave;
Weapons will clash, |
if to death I come not." 

22.
Messengers sent |
the mighty one then,
By land and by sea, |
a host to seek,
Store of wealth |
of the water's gleam,
And men to summon, |
and sons of men. 

23.
"Bid them straightway |
seek the ships,
And off Brandey |
ready to be!"
There the chief waited |
till thither were come
Men by hundreds |
from Hethinsey. 

24.
Soon off Stafnsnes |
stood the ships,
Fair they glided |
and gay with gold;
Then Helgi spake |
to Hjorleif asking:
"Hast thou counted |
the gallant host?" 

25.
The young king answered |
the other then:
"Long were it to tell |
from Tronueyr
The long-stemmed ships |
with warriors laden
That come from without |
into Orvasund. 

26.
"There are hundreds twelve |
of trusty men,
But in Hotun lies |
the host of the king,
Greater by half; |
I have hope of battle." 

27.
The ship's-tents soon |
the chieftain struck,
And waked the throng |
of warriors all;
(The heroes the red |
of dawn beheld;)
And on the masts |
the gallant men
Made fast the sails |
in Varinsfjord. 

28.
There was beat of oars |
and clash of iron,
Shield smote shield |
as the ships'-folk rowed;
Swiftly went |
the warrior-laden
Fleet of the ruler |
forth from the land. 

29.
So did it sound, |
when together the sisters
Of Kolga struck |
with the keels full long,
As if cliffs were broken |
with beating surf,

30.
Helgi bade higher |
hoist the sails,
Nor did the ships'-folk |
shun the waves,
Though dreadfully |
did Ægir's daughters
Seek the steeds |
of the sea to sink. 

31.
But from above |
did Sigrun brave
Aid the men and |
all their faring;
Mightily came |
from the claws of Ron
The leader's sea-beast |
off Gnipalund. 

32.
At evening there |
in Unavagar
Floated the fleet |
bedecked full fair;
But they who saw |
from Svarin's hill,
Bitter at heart |
the host beheld. 
33. Then Gothmund asked, |
goodly of birth,
"Who is the monarch |
who guides the host,
And to the land |
the warriors leads?" 

34.
Sinfjotli answered, |
and up on an oar
Raised a shield all red |
with golden rim;
A sea-sentry was he, |
skilled to speak,
And in words with princes |
well to strive. 

35.
"Say tonight |
when you feed the swine,
And send your bitches |
to seek their swill,
That out of the East |
have the Ylfings come,
Greedy for battle, |
to Gnipalund. 

36.
"There will Hothbrodd |
Helgi find,
In the midst of the fleet, |
and flight he scorns;
Often has he |
the eagles gorged,
Whilst thou at the quern |
wert slave-girls kissing." 
Gothmund spake:

37.
"Hero, the ancient |
sayings heed,
And bring not lies |
to the nobly born.

38.
"Thou hast eaten |
the entrails of wolves,
And of thy brothers |
the slayer been;
Oft wounds to suck |
thy cold mouth sought,
And loathed in rocky |
dens didst lurk." 
Sinfjotli spake:

39.
"A witch in Varin's |
isle thou wast,
A woman false, |
and lies didst fashion;
Of the mail-clad heroes |
thou wouldst have
No other, thou saidst, |
save Sinfjotli only. 

40.
"A Valkyrie wast thou, |
loathly Witch,
Evil and base, |
in Allfather's home;
The warriors all |
must ever fight,
Woman subtle, |
for sake of thee. 

41.
Nine did we |
in Sogunes
Of wolf-cubs have; |
I their father was." 
Gothmund spake:

42.
"Thou didst not father |
Fenrir's-wolves,
Though older thou art |
than all I know;
For they gelded thee |
in Gnipalund,
The giant-women |
at Thorsnes once. 

43.
"Under houses the stepson |
of Siggeir lay,
Fain of the wolf's cry |
out in the woods;
Evil came then all |
to thy hands,
When thy brothers' |
breasts thou didst redden,
Fame didst thou win |
for foulest deeds. 

44.
"In Bravoll wast thou |
Grani's bride,
Golden-bitted |
and ready to gallop;
I rode thee many |
a mile, and down
Didst sink, thou giantess, |
under the saddle." 
Sinfjotli spake:

45.
"A brainless fellow |
didst seem to be,
When once for Gollnir |
goats didst milk,
And another time |
when as Imth's daughter
In rags thou wentest; |
wilt longer wrangle?" 
Gothmund spake:

46.
"Sooner would I |
at Frekastein
Feed the ravens |
with flesh of thine
Than send your bitches |
to seek their swill,
Or feed the swine; |
may the fiends take you!" 
Helgi spake:

47.
"Better, Sinfjotli, |
thee 'twould beseem
Battle to give |
and eagles to gladden,
Than vain and empty |
words to utter,
Though ring-breakers oft |
in speech do wrangle. 

48.
"Good I find not |
the sons of Granmar,
But for heroes 'tis seemly |
the truth to speak;
At Moinsheimar |
proved the men
That hearts for the wielding |
of swords they had." 

49.
Mightily then |
they made to run
Sviputh and Sveggjuth |
to Solheimar;
(By dewy dales |
and chasms dark,
Mist's horse shook |
where the men went by;)
The king they found |
at his courtyard gate,
And told him the foeman |
fierce was come. 

50.
Forth stood Hothbrodd, |
helmed for battle,
Watched the riding |
of his warriors;
"Why are the Hniflungs |
white with fear?" 
Gothmund spake:

51.
"Swift keels lie |
hard by the land,
(Mast-ring harts |
and mighty yards,
Wealth of shields |
and well-planed oars;)
The king's fair host, |
the Ylfings haughty;
Fifteen bands |
to land have fared,
But out in Sogn |
are seven thousand. 

52.
"At anchor lying |
off Gnipalund
Are fire-beasts black, |
all fitted with gold;
There wait most |
of the foeman's men,
Nor will Helgi long |
the battle delay." 
Hothbrodd spake:

53.
"Bid the horses run |
to the Reginthing,
Melnir and Mylnir |
to Myrkwood now,
(And Sporvitnir |
to Sparinsheith;)
Let no man seek |
henceforth to sit
Who the flame of wounds |
knows well to wield. 

54.
"Summon Hogni, |
the sons of Hring,
Atli and Yngvi |
and Alf the Old;
Glad they are |
of battle ever;
Against the Volsungs |
let us go." 

55.
Swift as a storm |
there smote together
The flashing blades |
at Frekastein;
Ever was Helgi, |
Hunding's slayer,
First in the throng |
where warriors fought;
(Fierce in battle, |
slow to fly,
Hard the heart |
of the hero was.) 

56.
From heaven there came |
the maidens helmed,--
The weapon-clang grew,-- |
who watched o'er the king;
Spake Sigrun fair,-- |
the wound-givers flew,
And the horse of the giantess |
raven's-food had:-- 

57.
"Hail to thee, hero! |
full happy with men,
Offspring of Yngvi, |
shalt ever live,
For thou the fearless |
foe hast slain
Who to many the dread |
of death had brought. 

58.
"Warrior, well |
for thyself hast won
Red rings bright |
and the noble bride;
Both now, warrior, |
thine shall be,
Hogni's daughter |
and Hringstathir,
Wealth and triumph; |
the battle wanes."
