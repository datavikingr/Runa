In olden days
when ᛠgles scrᛠmed
And holy ᛥrᛠms
from hᛠvens crags fell
Was Helgi ᚦen
ᚦe herohᛠrted
Borghilds son
in Bralund born
2
‚Twas night in ᚦe dwelliᛝ
and Norns ᚦere came
Who ᛲaped ᚦe life
of ᚦe lofty one
ᚦey bade him moᛥ famed
of fighters all
And beᛥ of princes
ever to be
3
Mightily wove ᚦey
ᚦe web of fate
While Bralunds towns
were trembliᛝ all
And ᚦere ᚦe golden
ᚦrᛠds ᚦey wove
And in ᚦe mᛳns hall
faᛥ ᚦey made ᚦem
4
ᛠᛥ and weᛥ
ᚦe ends ᚦey hid
In ᚦe middle ᚦe hero
ᛲould have his land
And Neris kinswoman
norᚦward caᛥ
A chain and bade it
firm ever to be
5 Once sorrow had
ᚦe Ylfiᛝs son
And grief ᚦe bride
who ᚦe loved one had borne
Quoᚦ raven to raven
on treetop reᛥiᛝ
Seekiᛝ for fᛳd
ᚦere is someᚦiᛝ I know
6
In mailcoat ᛥands
ᚦe son of Sigmund
A halfday old
now day is here
His eyes flaᛲ ᛲarp
as ᚦe herᛟs are
He is friend of ᚦe wolves
full glad are we
7
ᚦe warrior ᚦroᛝ
a ruler ᚦought him
Gᛳd times ᚦey said
mankind ᛲould see
ᚦe kiᛝ himself
from battlepress came
To give ᚦe prince
a leek full proud
8
Helgi he named him
and Hriᛝᛥaᚦir gave him
Solfjoll Snᚫfjoll
and Sigarsvoll
Hriᛝᛥoᚦ Hotun
and Himinvaᛝar
And a blᛳdsnake bedecked
to Sinfjotlis broᚦer
9
Mighty he grew
in ᚦe midᛥ of his friends
ᚦe fairborn elm
in fortunes glow
To his comrades gold
he gladly gave
ᚦe hero spared not
ᚦe blᛳdflecked hoard
10
ᛲort time for war
ᚦe chieftain waited
When fifteen winters
old he was
Hundiᛝ he slew
ᚦe hardy wight
Who loᛝ had ruled
ᛟr lands and men
11
Of Sigmunds son
ᚦen next ᚦey sought
Hoard and riᛝs
ᚦe sons of Hundiᛝ
ᚦey bade ᚦe prince
requital pay
For bᛳty ᛥolen
and faᚦer slain
12
ᚦe prince let not
ᚦeir prayers avail
Nor gold for ᚦeir dᛠd
did ᚦe kinsmen get
Waitiᛝ he said
was a mighty ᛥorm
Of lances gray
and Oᚦins grimness
13
ᚦe warriors forᚦ
to ᚦe battle went
ᚦe field ᚦey chose
at Logafjoll
Froᚦis pᛠce
midᛥ fᛟs ᚦey broke
ᚦrough ᚦe isle went huᛝrily
Viᚦrirs hounds
14
ᚦe kiᛝ ᚦen sat
when he had slain
Eyjolf and Alf
nᛠᚦ ᚦe ᛠgleᛥone
Hjorvarᚦ and Hovarᚦ
Hundiᛝs sons
ᚦe kin of ᚦe spᛠrwielder
all had he killed
15
ᚦen glittered light
from Logafjoll
And from ᚦe light
ᚦe flaᛲes lᛠped
16
High under helms
on hᛠvens field
ᚦeir byrnies all
wiᚦ blᛳd were red
And from ᚦeir spᛠrs
ᚦe sparks flew forᚦ
17
ᛠrly ᚦen
in wolfwᛳd asked
ᚦe mighty kiᛝ
of ᚦe souᚦern maid
If wiᚦ ᚦe hero
home would ᛲe
Come ᚦat night
ᚦe wᛠpons claᛲed
18
Down from her horse
spraᛝ Hognis daughter
ᚦe ᛲields were ᛥill
and spake to ᚦe hero
Oᚦer tasks
are ours meᚦinks
ᚦan drinkiᛝ beer
wiᚦ ᚦe brᛠker of riᛝs
19
My faᚦer has pledged
his daughter fair
As bride to Granmars
son so grim
But Helgi I
once Hoᚦbrodd called
As fine a kiᛝ
as ᚦe son of a cat
20
Yet ᚦe hero will come
a few nights hence
Unless ᚦou doᛥ bid him
ᚦe battleground seek
Or takeᛥ ᚦe maid
from ᚦe warrior mighty
Helgi spake
21
Fᛠr him not
ᚦough Isuᛝ he felled
Firᛥ muᛥ our courage
keen be tried
Before unwilliᛝ
ᚦou fare wiᚦ ᚦe knave
Wᛠpons will claᛲ
if to dᛠᚦ I come not
22
Messeᛝers sent
ᚦe mighty one ᚦen
By land and by sᛠ
a hoᛥ to seek
ᛥore of wᛠlᚦ
of ᚦe waters glᛠm
And men to summon
and sons of men
23
Bid ᚦem ᛥraightway
seek ᚦe ᛲips
And off Brandey
rᛠdy to be
ᚦere ᚦe chief waited
till ᚦiᚦer were come
Men by hundreds
from Heᚦinsey
24
Sᛳn off ᛥafnsnes
ᛥᛳd ᚦe ᛲips
Fair ᚦey glided
and gay wiᚦ gold
ᚦen Helgi spake
to Hjorleif askiᛝ
Haᛥ ᚦou counted
ᚦe gallant hoᛥ
25
ᚦe youᛝ kiᛝ answered
ᚦe oᚦer ᚦen
Loᛝ were it to tell
from Tronueyr
ᚦe loᛝᛥemmed ᛲips
wiᚦ warriors laden
ᚦat come from wiᚦout
into Orvasund
26
ᚦere are hundreds twelve
of truᛥy men
But in Hotun lies
ᚦe hoᛥ of ᚦe kiᛝ
Grᛠter by half
I have hope of battle
27
ᚦe ᛲipᛥents sᛳn
ᚦe chieftain ᛥruck
And waked ᚦe ᚦroᛝ
of warriors all
ᚦe herᛟs ᚦe red
of dawn beheld
And on ᚦe maᛥs
ᚦe gallant men
Made faᛥ ᚦe sails
in Varinsfjord
28
ᚦere was bᛠt of oars
and claᛲ of iron
ᛲield smote ᛲield
as ᚦe ᛲipsfolk rowed
Swiftly went
ᚦe warriorladen
Fleet of ᚦe ruler
forᚦ from ᚦe land
29
So did it sound
when togeᚦer ᚦe siᛥers
Of Kolga ᛥruck
wiᚦ ᚦe keels full loᛝ
As if cliffs were broken
wiᚦ bᛠtiᛝ surf
30
Helgi bade higher
hoiᛥ ᚦe sails
Nor did ᚦe ᛲipsfolk
ᛲun ᚦe waves
ᚦough drᛠdfully
did ᚫgirs daughters
Seek ᚦe ᛥeeds
of ᚦe sᛠ to sink
31
But from above
did Sigrun brave
Aid ᚦe men and
all ᚦeir fariᛝ
Mightily came
from ᚦe claws of Ron
ᚦe lᛠders sᛠbᛠᛥ
off Gnipalund
32
At eveniᛝ ᚦere
in Unavagar
Floated ᚦe fleet
bedecked full fair
But ᚦey who saw
from Svarins hill
Bitter at hᛠrt
ᚦe hoᛥ beheld
33 ᚦen Goᚦmund asked
gᛳdly of birᚦ
Who is ᚦe monarch
who guides ᚦe hoᛥ
And to ᚦe land
ᚦe warriors lᛠds
34
Sinfjotli answered
and up on an oar
Raised a ᛲield all red
wiᚦ golden rim
A sᛠsentry was he
skilled to spᛠk
And in words wiᚦ princes
well to ᛥrive
35
Say tonight
when you feed ᚦe swine
And send your bitches
to seek ᚦeir swill
ᚦat out of ᚦe ᛠᛥ
have ᚦe Ylfiᛝs come
Greedy for battle
to Gnipalund
36
ᚦere will Hoᚦbrodd
Helgi find
In ᚦe midᛥ of ᚦe fleet
and flight he scorns
Often has he
ᚦe ᛠgles gorged
Whilᛥ ᚦou at ᚦe quern
wert slavegirls kissiᛝ
Goᚦmund spake
37
Hero ᚦe ancient
sayiᛝs heed
And briᛝ not lies
to ᚦe nobly born
38
ᚦou haᛥ ᛠten
ᚦe entrails of wolves
And of ᚦy broᚦers
ᚦe slayer been
Oft wounds to suck
ᚦy cold mouᚦ sought
And loaᚦed in rocky
dens didᛥ lurk
Sinfjotli spake
39
A witch in Varins
isle ᚦou waᛥ
A woman false
and lies didᛥ faᛲion
Of ᚦe mailclad herᛟs
ᚦou wouldᛥ have
No oᚦer ᚦou saidᛥ
save Sinfjotli only
40
A Valkyrie waᛥ ᚦou
loaᚦly Witch
Evil and base
in Allfaᚦers home
ᚦe warriors all
muᛥ ever fight
Woman subtle
for sake of ᚦee
41
Nine did we
in Sogunes
Of wolfcubs have
I ᚦeir faᚦer was
Goᚦmund spake
42
ᚦou didᛥ not faᚦer
Fenrirswolves
ᚦough older ᚦou art
ᚦan all I know
For ᚦey gelded ᚦee
in Gnipalund
ᚦe giantwomen
at ᚦorsnes once
43
Under houses ᚦe ᛥepson
of Siggeir lay
Fain of ᚦe wolfs cry
out in ᚦe wᛳds
Evil came ᚦen all
to ᚦy hands
When ᚦy broᚦers
brᛠᛥs ᚦou didᛥ redden
Fame didᛥ ᚦou win
for fouleᛥ deeds
44
In Bravoll waᛥ ᚦou
Granis bride
Goldenbitted
and rᛠdy to gallop
I rode ᚦee many
a mile and down
Didᛥ sink ᚦou giantess
under ᚦe saddle
Sinfjotli spake
45
A brainless fellow
didᛥ seem to be
When once for Gollnir
goats didᛥ milk
And anoᚦer time
when as Imᚦs daughter
In rags ᚦou wenteᛥ
wilt loᛝer wraᛝle
Goᚦmund spake
46
Sᛳner would I
at Frekaᛥein
Feed ᚦe ravens
wiᚦ fleᛲ of ᚦine
ᚦan send your bitches
to seek ᚦeir swill
Or feed ᚦe swine
may ᚦe fiends take you
Helgi spake
47
Better Sinfjotli
ᚦee twould beseem
Battle to give
and ᛠgles to gladden
ᚦan vain and empty
words to utter
ᚦough riᛝbrᛠkers oft
in speech do wraᛝle
48
Gᛳd I find not
ᚦe sons of Granmar
But for herᛟs tis seemly
ᚦe truᚦ to spᛠk
At Moinᛲeimar
proved ᚦe men
ᚦat hᛠrts for ᚦe wieldiᛝ
of swords ᚦey had
49
Mightily ᚦen
ᚦey made to run
Svipuᚦ and Sveggjuᚦ
to Solheimar
By dewy dales
and chasms dark
Miᛥs horse ᛲᛳk
where ᚦe men went by
ᚦe kiᛝ ᚦey found
at his courtyard gate
And told him ᚦe fᛟman

50
Forᚦ ᛥᛳd Hoᚦbrodd
helmed for battle
Watched ᚦe ridiᛝ
of his warriors
Why are ᚦe Hnifluᛝs

Goᚦmund spake
51
Swift keels lie
hard by ᚦe land
Maᛥriᛝ harts
and mighty yards
Wᛠlᚦ of ᛲields
and wellplaned oars
ᚦe kiᛝs fair hoᛥ
ᚦe Ylfiᛝs haughty
Fifteen bands

But out in Sogn

52
At anchor lyiᛝ
off Gnipalund
Are firebᛠᛥs black
all fitted wiᚦ gold
ᚦere wait moᛥ
of ᚦe fᛟmans men
Nor will Helgi loᛝ
ᚦe battle delay
Hoᚦbrodd spake
53
Bid ᚦe horses run
to ᚦe Reginᚦiᛝ
Melnir and Mylnir
to Myrkwᛳd now
And Sporvitnir
to Sparinᛲeiᚦ
Let no man seek

Who ᚦe flame of wounds

54
Summon Hogni

Atli and Yᛝvi
and Alf ᚦe Old
Glad ᚦey are
of battle ever
Againᛥ ᚦe Volsuᛝs

55
Swift as a ᛥorm
ᚦere smote togeᚦer
ᚦe flaᛲiᛝ blades
at Frekaᛥein
Ever was Helgi
Hundiᛝs slayer
Firᛥ in ᚦe ᚦroᛝ
where warriors fought
Fierce in battle

Hard ᚦe hᛠrt

56
From hᛠven ᚦere came
ᚦe maidens helmed
ᚦe wᛠponclaᛝ grew

Hail to ᚦee hero
