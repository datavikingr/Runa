ᚦor was on his way back from a journey in ᚦe ᛠᛥ and came to a sound
on ᚦe oᚦer side of ᚦe sound was a ferryman wiᚦ a boat
ᚦor called out
1
Who is ᚦe fellow yonder
on ᚦe farᚦer ᛲore of ᚦe sound
ᚦe ferryman spake
2
What kind of a pᛠsant is yon
ᚦat calls ᛟr ᚦe bay
ᚦor spake
3
Ferry me over ᚦe sound
I will feed ᚦee ᚦerefor in ᚦe morniᛝ
A basket I have on my back
and fᛳd ᚦerein none better
At leisure I ate
ere ᚦe house I left
Of herriᛝs and porridge
so plenty I had
ᚦe ferryman spake
4
Of ᚦy morniᛝ fᛠts art ᚦou proud
but ᚦe future ᚦou knoweᛥ not wholly
Doleful ᚦine homecomiᛝ is
ᚦy moᚦer me ᚦinks is dᛠd
ᚦor spake
5
Now haᛥ ᚦou said
what to ᛠch muᛥ seem
ᚦe mightieᛥ grief
ᚦat my moᚦer is dᛠd
ᚦe ferryman spake
6
ᚦree gᛳd dwelliᛝs
meᚦinks ᚦou haᛥ not
Barefᛳt ᚦou ᛥandeᛥ
and wᛠreᛥ a beggars dress
Not even hose doᛥ ᚦou have
ᚦor spake
7 ᛥeer ᚦou hiᚦer ᚦe boat
ᚦe landiᛝ here ᛲall I ᛲow ᚦee
But whose ᚦe craft
ᚦat ᚦou keepeᛥ on ᚦe ᛲore
ᚦe ferryman spake
8
Hildolf is he
who bade me have it
A hero wise
his home is at Raᚦseys sound
He bade me no robbers to ᛥeer
nor ᛥᛠlers of ᛥeeds
But worᚦy men
and ᚦose whom well do I know
Say now ᚦy name
if over ᚦe sound ᚦou wilt fare
ᚦor spake
9
My name indeed ᛲall I tell
ᚦough in daᛝer I am
And all my race
I am Oᚦins son
Meilis broᚦer
and Magnis faᚦer
ᚦe ᛥroᛝ one of ᚦe gods
wiᚦ ᚦor now speech canᛥ ᚦou get
And now would I know
what name ᚦou haᛥ
ᚦe ferryman spake
10
Harbarᚦ am I
and seldom I hide my name
ᚦor spake
11
Why ᛲouldᛥ ᚦou hide ᚦy name
if quarrel ᚦou haᛥ not
Harbarᚦ spake
12
And ᚦough I had a quarrel
from such as ᚦou art
Yet none ᚦe less
my life would I guard
Unless I be dᛳmed to die
ᚦor spake
13
Grᛠt trouble meᚦinks
would it be to come to ᚦee
To wade ᚦe waters across
and wet my middle
Wᛠkliᛝ well ᛲall I pay
ᚦy mockiᛝ words
if across ᚦe sound I come
Harbarᚦ spake
14
Here ᛲall I ᛥand
and await ᚦee here
ᚦou haᛥ found since Hruᛝnir died
no fiercer man
ᚦor spake
15
Fain art ᚦou to tell
how wiᚦ Hruᛝnir I fought
ᚦe haughty giant
whose hᛠd of ᛥone was made
And yet I felled him
and ᛥretched him before me
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spake
16
Five full winters
wiᚦ Fjolvar was I
And dwelt in ᚦe isle
ᚦat is Algrön called
ᚦere could we fight
and fell ᚦe slain
Much could we seek
and maids could maᛥer
ᚦor spake
17
How won ye success wiᚦ your women
Harbarᚦ spake
18
Lively women we had
if ᚦey wise for us were
Wise were ᚦe women we had
if ᚦey kind for us were
For ropes of sand
ᚦey would seek to wind
And ᚦe bottom to dig
from ᚦe deepeᛥ dale
Wiser ᚦan all
in counsel I was
And ᚦere I slept
by ᚦe siᛥers seven
And joy full grᛠt
did I get from ᛠch
What ᚦor didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
ᚦor spake
19
ᚦjazi I felled
ᚦe giant fierce
And I hurled ᚦe eyes
of Alvaldis son
To ᚦe hᛠvens hot above
Of my deeds ᚦe mightieᛥ
marks are ᚦese
ᚦat all men since can see
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spoke
20
Much lovecraft I wrought
wiᚦ ᚦem who ride by night
When I ᛥole ᚦem by ᛥᛠlᚦ from ᚦeir husbands
A giant hard
was Hlebarᚦ meᚦinks
His wand he gave me as gift
And I ᛥole his wits away
ᚦor spake
21
ᚦou didᛥ repay gᛳd gifts wiᚦ evil mind
Harbarᚦ spake
22
ᚦe oak muᛥ have
what it ᛲaves from anoᚦer
In such ᚦiᛝs ᛠch for himself
What ᚦor didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
ᚦor spake
23
ᛠᛥward I fared
of ᚦe giants I felled
ᚦeir illworkiᛝ women
who went to ᚦe mountain
And large were ᚦe giants ᚦroᛝ
if all were alive
No men would ᚦere be
in Miᚦgarᚦ more
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spake
24
In Valland I was
and wars I raised
Princes I aᛝered
and pᛠce brought never
ᚦe noble who fall
in ᚦe fight haᚦ Oᚦin
And ᚦor haᚦ ᚦe race of ᚦe ᚦralls
ᚦor spake
25
Unequal gifts
of men wouldᛥ ᚦou give to ᚦe gods
If might tᛳ much ᚦou ᛲouldᛥ have
Harbarᚦ spake
26
ᚦor has might enough
but never a hᛠrt
For cowardly fᛠr
in a glove waᛥ ᚦou fain to crawl
And ᚦere forgot ᚦou waᛥ ᚦor
Afraid ᚦere ᚦou waᛥ
ᚦy fᛠr was such
To fart or sneeze
leᛥ Fjalar ᛲould hᛠr
ᚦor spake
27
ᚦou womaniᛲ Harbarᚦ
to hell would I smite ᚦee ᛥraight
Could mine arm rᛠch over ᚦe sound
Harbarᚦ spake
28
Wherefore rᛠch over ᚦe sound
since ᛥrife we have none
What ᚦor didᛥ ᚦou do ᚦen
ᚦor spake
29
ᛠᛥward I was
and ᚦe river I guarded well
Where ᚦe sons of Svaraᛝ
sought me ᚦere
ᛥones did ᚦey hurl
small joy did ᚦey have of winniᛝ
Before me ᚦere
to ask for pᛠce did ᚦey fare
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spake
30
ᛠᛥward I was
and spake wiᚦ a certain one
I played wiᚦ ᚦe linenwhite maid
and met her by ᛥᛠlᚦ
I gladdened ᚦe golddecked one
and ᛲe granted me joy
ᚦor spake
31
Full fair was ᚦy womanfindiᛝ
Harbarᚦ spake
32
ᚦy help did I need ᚦen ᚦor
to hold ᚦe white maid faᛥ
ᚦor spake
33
Gladly had I been ᚦere
my help to ᚦee had been given
Harbarᚦ spake
34
I might have truᛥed ᚦee ᚦen
didᛥ ᚦou not betray ᚦy troᚦ
ᚦor spake
35
No heelbiter am I in truᚦ
like an old lᛠᚦer ᛲᛟ in spriᛝ
Harbarᚦ spoke
36
What ᚦor didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
ᚦor spake
37
In Hlesey ᚦe brides
of ᚦe Berserkers slew I
Moᛥ evil ᚦey were
and all ᚦey betrayed
Harbarᚦ spake
38
ᛲame didᛥ ᚦou win
ᚦat women ᚦou sleweᛥ ᚦor
ᚦor spake
39
ᛲewolves ᚦey were like
and women but little
My ᛲip which well
I had trimmed did ᚦey ᛲake
Wiᚦ clubs of iron ᚦey ᚦrᛠtened
and ᚦjalfi ᚦey drove off
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spake
40
In ᚦe hoᛥ I was
ᚦat hiᚦer fared
ᚦe banners to raise
and ᚦe spᛠr to redden
ᚦor spake
41
Wilt ᚦou now say
ᚦat hatred ᚦou soughteᛥ to briᛝ us
Harbarᚦ spake
42
A riᛝ for ᚦy hand
ᛲall make all right for ᚦee
As ᚦe judge decides
who sets us two at pᛠce
ᚦor spake
43
Where foundeᛥ ᚦou
so foul and scornful a speech
More foul a speech
I never before have hᛠrd
Harbarᚦ spake
44
I lᛠrned it from men
ᚦe men so old
Who dwell in ᚦe hills of home
ᚦor spake
45
A name full gᛳd
to hᛠps of ᛥones ᚦou giveᛥ
When ᚦou calleᛥ ᚦem hills of home
Harbarᚦ spake
46
Of such ᚦiᛝs spᛠk I so
ᚦor spake
47
Ill for ᚦee comes
ᚦy keenness of toᛝue
If ᚦe water I chᛳse to wade
Louder I ween
ᚦan a wolf ᚦou cryeᛥ
If a blow of my hammer ᚦou haᛥ
Harbarᚦ spake
48
Sif has a lover at home
and him ᛲouldᛥ ᚦou meet
More fittiᛝ it were
on him to put forᚦ ᚦy ᛥreᛝᚦ
ᚦor spake
49
ᚦy toᛝue ᛥill makes ᚦee say
what seems moᛥ ill to me
ᚦou witless man ᚦou lieᛥ I ween
Harbarᚦ spake
50
Truᚦ do I spᛠk
but slow on ᚦy way ᚦou art
Far hadᛥ ᚦou gone
if now in ᚦe boat ᚦou hadᛥ fared
ᚦor spake
51
ᚦou womaniᛲ Harbarᚦ
here haᛥ ᚦou held me tᛳ loᛝ
Harbarᚦ spake
52
I ᚦought not ever
ᚦat Asaᚦor would be hindered
By a ferryman ᚦus from fariᛝ
ᚦor spake
53
One counsel I briᛝ ᚦee now
row hiᚦer ᚦy boat
No more of scoffiᛝ
set Magnis faᚦer across
Harbarᚦ spake
54
From ᚦe sound go hence
ᚦe passage ᚦou haᛥ not
ᚦor spake
55
ᚦe way now ᛲow me
since ᚦou takeᛥ me not ᛟr ᚦe water
Harbarᚦ spake
56
To refuse it is little
to fare it is loᛝ
A while to ᚦe ᛥock
and a while to ᚦe ᛥone
ᚦen ᚦe road to ᚦy left
till Verland ᚦou rᛠcheᛥ
And ᚦere ᛲall Fjorgyn
her son ᚦor find
And ᚦe road of her children
ᛲe ᛲows him to Oᚦins rᛠlm
ᚦor spake
57
May I come so far in a day
Harbarᚦ spake
58
Wiᚦ toil and trouble perchance
While ᚦe sun ᛥill ᛲines
or so I ᚦink
ᚦor spake
59
ᛲort now ᛲall be our speech
for ᚦou spᛠkeᛥ in mockery only
ᚦe passage ᚦou gaveᛥ me not
I ᛲall pay ᚦee if ever we meet
Harbarᚦ spake
60
Get hence where every evil ᚦiᛝ ᛲall have ᚦee
