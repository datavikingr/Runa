ᚦor was on his way back from a journey in ᚦe ᛠᛥ and came to a sound
on ᚦe oᚦer side of ᚦe sound was a feryman wiᚦ a boat
ᚦor caled out
1
Who is ᚦe felow yonder
on ᚦe farᚦer ᛲore of ᚦe sound
ᚦe feryman spake
2
What kind of a pᛠsant is yon
ᚦat cals ᛟr ᚦe bay
ᚦor spake
3
Fery me over ᚦe sound
I wil fed ᚦe ᚦerefor in ᚦe morniᛝ
A basket I have on my back
and fᛳd ᚦerein none beter
At leisure I ate
ere ᚦe house I left
Of heriᛝs and poridge
so plenty I had
ᚦe feryman spake
4
Of ᚦy morniᛝ fᛠts art ᚦou proud
but ᚦe future ᚦou knoweᛥ not wholy
Doleful ᚦine homecomiᛝ is
ᚦy moᚦer me ᚦinks is dᛠd
ᚦor spake
5
Now haᛥ ᚦou said

ᚦe feryman spake
6

Barefᛳt ᚦou ᛥandeᛥ
and wᛠreᛥ a begars dres
Not even hose doᛥ ᚦou have
ᚦor spake
7 ᛥer ᚦou hiᚦer ᚦe boat
ᚦe landiᛝ here ᛲal I ᛲow ᚦe
But whose ᚦe craft
ᚦat ᚦou kepeᛥ on ᚦe ᛲore
ᚦe feryman spake
8
Hildolf is he
who bade me have it
A hero wise
his home is at Raᚦseys sound
He bade me no robers to ᛥer
nor ᛥᛠlers of ᛥeds
But worᚦy men
and ᚦose whom wel do I know
Say now ᚦy name
if over ᚦe sound ᚦou wilt fare
ᚦor spake
9
My name inded ᛲal I tel
ᚦough in daᛝer I am
And al my race
I am Oᚦins son
Meilis broᚦer
and Magnis faᚦer
ᚦe ᛥroᛝ one of ᚦe gods
wiᚦ ᚦor now spech canᛥ ᚦou get
And now would I know
what name ᚦou haᛥ
ᚦe feryman spake
10
Harbarᚦ am I
and seldom I hide my name
ᚦor spake
1
Why ᛲouldᛥ ᚦou hide ᚦy name
if quarel ᚦou haᛥ not
Harbarᚦ spake
12
And ᚦough I had a quarel
from such as ᚦou art
Yet none ᚦe les
my life would I guard
Unles I be dᛳmed to die
ᚦor spake
13
Grᛠt trouble meᚦinks
would it be to come to ᚦe
To wade ᚦe waters acros
and wet my midle
Wᛠkliᛝ wel ᛲal I pay
ᚦy mockiᛝ words
if acros ᚦe sound I come
Harbarᚦ spake
14
Here ᛲal I ᛥand
and await ᚦe here
ᚦou haᛥ found since Hruᛝnir died
no fiercer man
ᚦor spake
15
Fain art ᚦou to tel
how wiᚦ Hruᛝnir I fought
ᚦe haughty giant
whose hᛠd of ᛥone was made
And yet I feled him
and ᛥretched him before me
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spake
16
Five ful winters
wiᚦ Fjolvar was I
And dwelt in ᚦe isle
ᚦat is Algrön caled
ᚦere could we fight
and fel ᚦe slain
Much could we sek
and maids could maᛥer
ᚦor spake
17
How won ye suces wiᚦ your women
Harbarᚦ spake
18
Lively women we had
if ᚦey wise for us were
Wise were ᚦe women we had
if ᚦey kind for us were
For ropes of sand
ᚦey would sek to wind
And ᚦe botom to dig
from ᚦe depeᛥ dale
Wiser ᚦan al
in counsel I was
And ᚦere I slept
by ᚦe siᛥers seven
And joy ful grᛠt
did I get from ᛠch
What ᚦor didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
ᚦor spake
19
ᚦjazi I feled
ᚦe giant fierce
And I hurled ᚦe eyes
of Alvaldis son
To ᚦe hᛠvens hot above
Of my deds ᚦe mightieᛥ
marks are ᚦese
ᚦat al men since can se
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spoke
20
Much lovecraft I wrought
wiᚦ ᚦem who ride by night
When I ᛥole ᚦem by ᛥᛠlᚦ from ᚦeir husbands
A giant hard
was Hlebarᚦ meᚦinks
His wand he gave me as gift
And I ᛥole his wits away
ᚦor spake
21
ᚦou didᛥ repay gᛳd gifts wiᚦ evil mind
Harbarᚦ spake
2
ᚦe oak muᛥ have
what it ᛲaves from anoᚦer
In such ᚦiᛝs ᛠch for himself
What ᚦor didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
ᚦor spake
23
ᛠᛥward I fared
of ᚦe giants I feled
ᚦeir ilworkiᛝ women
who went to ᚦe mountain
And large were ᚦe giants ᚦroᛝ
if al were alive
No men would ᚦere be
in Miᚦgarᚦ more
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spake
24
In Valand I was
and wars I raised
Princes I aᛝered
and pᛠce brought never
ᚦe noble who fal
in ᚦe fight haᚦ Oᚦin
And ᚦor haᚦ ᚦe race of ᚦe ᚦrals
ᚦor spake
25
Unequal gifts
of men wouldᛥ ᚦou give to ᚦe gods
If might tᛳ much ᚦou ᛲouldᛥ have
Harbarᚦ spake
26
ᚦor has might enough
but never a hᛠrt
For cowardly fᛠr
in a glove waᛥ ᚦou fain to crawl
And ᚦere forgot ᚦou waᛥ ᚦor
Afraid ᚦere ᚦou waᛥ
ᚦy fᛠr was such
To fart or sneze
leᛥ Fjalar ᛲould hᛠr
ᚦor spake
27
ᚦou womaniᛲ Harbarᚦ
to hel would I smite ᚦe ᛥraight
Could mine arm rᛠch over ᚦe sound
Harbarᚦ spake
28
Wherefore rᛠch over ᚦe sound
since ᛥrife we have none
What ᚦor didᛥ ᚦou do ᚦen
ᚦor spake
29
ᛠᛥward I was
and ᚦe river I guarded wel
Where ᚦe sons of Svaraᛝ
sought me ᚦere
ᛥones did ᚦey hurl
smal joy did ᚦey have of winiᛝ
Before me ᚦere
to ask for pᛠce did ᚦey fare
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spake
30
ᛠᛥward I was
and spake wiᚦ a certain one
I played wiᚦ ᚦe linenwhite maid
and met her by ᛥᛠlᚦ
I gladened ᚦe goldecked one
and ᛲe granted me joy
ᚦor spake
31
Ful fair was ᚦy womanfindiᛝ
Harbarᚦ spake
32
ᚦy help did I ned ᚦen ᚦor
to hold ᚦe white maid faᛥ
ᚦor spake
3
Gladly had I ben ᚦere
my help to ᚦe had ben given
Harbarᚦ spake
34
I might have truᛥed ᚦe ᚦen
didᛥ ᚦou not betray ᚦy troᚦ
ᚦor spake
35
No helbiter am I in truᚦ
like an old lᛠᚦer ᛲᛟ in spriᛝ
Harbarᚦ spoke
36
What ᚦor didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
ᚦor spake
37
In Hlesey ᚦe brides
of ᚦe Berserkers slew I
Moᛥ evil ᚦey were
and al ᚦey betrayed
Harbarᚦ spake
38
ᛲame didᛥ ᚦou win
ᚦat women ᚦou sleweᛥ ᚦor
ᚦor spake
39
ᛲewolves ᚦey were like
and women but litle
My ᛲip which wel
I had trimed did ᚦey ᛲake
Wiᚦ clubs of iron ᚦey ᚦrᛠtened
and ᚦjalfi ᚦey drove of
What Harbarᚦ didᛥ ᚦou ᚦe while
Harbarᚦ spake
40
In ᚦe hoᛥ I was
ᚦat hiᚦer fared
ᚦe baners to raise
and ᚦe spᛠr to reden
ᚦor spake
41
Wilt ᚦou now say
ᚦat hatred ᚦou soughteᛥ to briᛝ us
Harbarᚦ spake
42
A riᛝ for ᚦy hand
ᛲal make al right for ᚦe
As ᚦe judge decides
who sets us two at pᛠce
ᚦor spake
43
Where foundeᛥ ᚦou
so foul and scornful a spech
More foul a spech
I never before have hᛠrd
Harbarᚦ spake
4
I lᛠrned it from men
ᚦe men so old
Who dwel in ᚦe hils of home
ᚦor spake
45
A name ful gᛳd
to hᛠps of ᛥones ᚦou giveᛥ
When ᚦou caleᛥ ᚦem hils of home
Harbarᚦ spake
46
Of such ᚦiᛝs spᛠk I so
ᚦor spake
47
Il for ᚦe comes
ᚦy kenes of toᛝue
If ᚦe water I chᛳse to wade
Louder I wen
ᚦan a wolf ᚦou cryeᛥ
If a blow of my hamer ᚦou haᛥ
Harbarᚦ spake
48
Sif has a lover at home
and him ᛲouldᛥ ᚦou met
More fitiᛝ it were
on him to put forᚦ ᚦy ᛥreᛝᚦ
ᚦor spake
49
ᚦy toᛝue ᛥil makes ᚦe say
what sems moᛥ il to me
ᚦou witles man ᚦou lieᛥ I wen
Harbarᚦ spake
50
Truᚦ do I spᛠk
but slow on ᚦy way ᚦou art
Far hadᛥ ᚦou gone
if now in ᚦe boat ᚦou hadᛥ fared
ᚦor spake
51
ᚦou womaniᛲ Harbarᚦ
here haᛥ ᚦou held me tᛳ loᛝ
Harbarᚦ spake
52
I ᚦought not ever
ᚦat Asaᚦor would be hindered
By a feryman ᚦus from fariᛝ
ᚦor spake
53
One counsel I briᛝ ᚦe now
row hiᚦer ᚦy boat
No more of scofiᛝ
set Magnis faᚦer acros
Harbarᚦ spake
54
From ᚦe sound go hence
ᚦe pasage ᚦou haᛥ not
ᚦor spake
5
ᚦe way now ᛲow me
since ᚦou takeᛥ me not ᛟr ᚦe water
Harbarᚦ spake
56
To refuse it is litle
to fare it is loᛝ
A while to ᚦe ᛥock
and a while to ᚦe ᛥone
ᚦen ᚦe road to ᚦy left
til Verland ᚦou rᛠcheᛥ
And ᚦere ᛲal Fjorgyn
her son ᚦor find
And ᚦe road of her children
ᛲe ᛲows him to Oᚦins rᛠlm
ᚦor spake
57
May I come so far in a day
Harbarᚦ spake
58
Wiᚦ toil and trouble perchance
While ᚦe sun ᛥil ᛲines
or so I ᚦink
ᚦor spake
59
ᛲort now ᛲal be our spech
for ᚦou spᛠkeᛥ in mockery only
ᚦe pasage ᚦou gaveᛥ me not
I ᛲal pay ᚦe if ever we met
Harbarᚦ spake
60
Get hence where every evil ᚦiᛝ ᛲal have ᚦe
