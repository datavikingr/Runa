Thor was on his way back from a journey in the East and came to a sound 
on the other side of the sound was a ferryman with a boat 
Thor called out 
1
Who is the fellow yonder 
on the farther shore of the sound 
The ferryman spake
2
What kind of a peasant is yon 
that calls oer the bay 
Thor spake
3
Ferry me over the sound 
I will feed thee therefor in the morning
A basket I have on my back 
and food therein none better
At leisure I ate 
ere the house I left
Of herrings and porridge 
so plenty I had 
The ferryman spake
4
Of thy morning feats art thou proud 
but the future thou knowest not wholly
Doleful thine homecoming is 
thy mother me thinks is dead 
Thor spake
5
Now hast thou said 
what to each must seem
The mightiest grief 
that my mother is dead 
The ferryman spake
6
Three good dwellings 
methinks thou hast not
Barefoot thou standest 
and wearest a beggars dress
Not even hose dost thou have 
Thor spake
7 Steer thou hither the boat 
the landing here shall I show thee
But whose the craft 
that thou keepest on the shore 
The ferryman spake
8
Hildolf is he 
who bade me have it
A hero wise 
his home is at Rathseys sound
He bade me no robbers to steer 
nor stealers of steeds
But worthy men 
and those whom well do I know
Say now thy name 
if over the sound thou wilt fare 
Thor spake
9
My name indeed shall I tell 
though in danger I am
And all my race 
I am Othins son
Meilis brother 
and Magnis father
The strong one of the gods 
with Thor now speech canst thou get
And now would I know 
what name thou hast 
The ferryman spake
10
Harbarth am I 
and seldom I hide my name 
Thor spake
11
Why shouldst thou hide thy name 
if quarrel thou hast not 
Harbarth spake
12
And though I had a quarrel 
from such as thou art
Yet none the less 
my life would I guard
Unless I be doomed to die 
Thor spake
13
Great trouble methinks 
would it be to come to thee
To wade the waters across 
and wet my middle
Weakling well shall I pay 
thy mocking words
if across the sound I come 
Harbarth spake
14
Here shall I stand 
and await thee here
Thou hast found since Hrungnir died 
no fiercer man 
Thor spake
15
Fain art thou to tell 
how with Hrungnir I fought
The haughty giant 
whose head of stone was made
And yet I felled him 
and stretched him before me
What Harbarth didst thou the while 
Harbarth spake
16
Five full winters 
with Fjolvar was I
And dwelt in the isle 
that is Algr√∂n called
There could we fight 
and fell the slain
Much could we seek 
and maids could master 
Thor spake
17
How won ye success with your women 
Harbarth spake
18
Lively women we had 
if they wise for us were
Wise were the women we had 
if they kind for us were
For ropes of sand 
they would seek to wind
And the bottom to dig 
from the deepest dale
Wiser than all 
in counsel I was
And there I slept 
by the sisters seven
And joy full great 
did I get from each
What Thor didst thou the while 
Thor spake
19
Thjazi I felled 
the giant fierce
And I hurled the eyes 
of Alvaldis son
To the heavens hot above
Of my deeds the mightiest 
marks are these
That all men since can see
What Harbarth didst thou the while 
Harbarth spoke
20
Much lovecraft I wrought 
with them who ride by night
When I stole them by stealth from their husbands
A giant hard 
was Hlebarth methinks
His wand he gave me as gift
And I stole his wits away 
Thor spake
21
Thou didst repay good gifts with evil mind 
Harbarth spake
22
The oak must have 
what it shaves from another
In such things each for himself
What Thor didst thou the while 
Thor spake
23
Eastward I fared 
of the giants I felled
Their illworking women 
who went to the mountain
And large were the giants throng 
if all were alive
No men would there be 
in Mithgarth more
What Harbarth didst thou the while 
Harbarth spake
24
In Valland I was 
and wars I raised
Princes I angered 
and peace brought never
The noble who fall 
in the fight hath Othin
And Thor hath the race of the thralls 
Thor spake
25
Unequal gifts 
of men wouldst thou give to the gods
If might too much thou shouldst have 
Harbarth spake
26
Thor has might enough 
but never a heart
For cowardly fear 
in a glove wast thou fain to crawl
And there forgot thou wast Thor
Afraid there thou wast 
thy fear was such
To fart or sneeze 
lest Fjalar should hear 
Thor spake
27
Thou womanish Harbarth 
to hell would I smite thee straight
Could mine arm reach over the sound 
Harbarth spake
28
Wherefore reach over the sound 
since strife we have none
What Thor didst thou do then 
Thor spake
29
Eastward I was 
and the river I guarded well
Where the sons of Svarang 
sought me there
Stones did they hurl 
small joy did they have of winning
Before me there 
to ask for peace did they fare
What Harbarth didst thou the while 
Harbarth spake
30
Eastward I was 
and spake with a certain one
I played with the linenwhite maid 
and met her by stealth
I gladdened the golddecked one 
and she granted me joy 
Thor spake
31
Full fair was thy womanfinding 
Harbarth spake
32
Thy help did I need then Thor 
to hold the white maid fast 
Thor spake
33
Gladly had I been there 
my help to thee had been given 
Harbarth spake
34
I might have trusted thee then 
didst thou not betray thy troth 
Thor spake
35
No heelbiter am I in truth 
like an old leather shoe in spring 
Harbarth spoke
36
What Thor didst thou the while 
Thor spake
37
In Hlesey the brides 
of the Berserkers slew I
Most evil they were 
and all they betrayed 
Harbarth spake
38
Shame didst thou win 
that women thou slewest Thor 
Thor spake
39
Shewolves they were like 
and women but little
My ship which well 
I had trimmed did they shake
With clubs of iron they threatened 
and Thjalfi they drove off
What Harbarth didst thou the while 
Harbarth spake
40
In the host I was 
that hither fared
The banners to raise 
and the spear to redden 
Thor spake
41
Wilt thou now say 
that hatred thou soughtest to bring us 
Harbarth spake
42
A ring for thy hand 
shall make all right for thee
As the judge decides 
who sets us two at peace 
Thor spake
43
Where foundest thou 
so foul and scornful a speech
More foul a speech 
I never before have heard 
Harbarth spake
44
I learned it from men 
the men so old
Who dwell in the hills of home 
Thor spake
45
A name full good 
to heaps of stones thou givest
When thou callest them hills of home 
Harbarth spake
46
Of such things speak I so 
Thor spake
47
Ill for thee comes 
thy keenness of tongue
If the water I choose to wade
Louder I ween 
than a wolf thou cryest
If a blow of my hammer thou hast 
Harbarth spake
48
Sif has a lover at home 
and him shouldst thou meet
More fitting it were 
on him to put forth thy strength 
Thor spake
49
Thy tongue still makes thee say 
what seems most ill to me
Thou witless man Thou liest I ween 
Harbarth spake
50
Truth do I speak 
but slow on thy way thou art
Far hadst thou gone 
if now in the boat thou hadst fared 
Thor spake
51
Thou womanish Harbarth 
here hast thou held me too long 
Harbarth spake
52
I thought not ever 
that Asathor would be hindered
By a ferryman thus from faring 
Thor spake
53
One counsel I bring thee now 
row hither thy boat
No more of scoffing 
set Magnis father across 
Harbarth spake
54
From the sound go hence 
the passage thou hast not 
Thor spake
55
The way now show me 
since thou takest me not oer the water 
Harbarth spake
56
To refuse it is little 
to fare it is long
A while to the stock 
and a while to the stone
Then the road to thy left 
till Verland thou reachest
And there shall Fjorgyn 
her son Thor find
And the road of her children 
she shows him to Othins realm 
Thor spake
57
May I come so far in a day 
Harbarth spake
58
With toil and trouble perchance
While the sun still shines 
or so I think 
Thor spake
59
Short now shall be our speech 
for thou speakest in mockery only
The passage thou gavest me not 
I shall pay thee if ever we meet 
Harbarth spake
60
Get hence where every evil thing shall have thee
