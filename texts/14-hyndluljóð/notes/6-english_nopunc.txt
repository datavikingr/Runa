Freyja spake
1
Maiden awake 
wake thee my friend
My sister Hyndla 
in thy hollow cave
Already comes darkness 
and ride must we
To Valhall to seek 
the sacred hall 
2
The favor of Heerfather 
seek we to find
To his followers gold 
he gladly gives
To Hermoth gave he 
helm and mailcoat
And to Sigmund he gave 
a sword as gift 
3
Triumph to some 
and treasure to others
To many wisdom 
and skill in words
Fair winds to the sailor 
to the singer his art
And a manly heart 
to many a hero 
4
Thor shall I honor 
and this shall I ask
That his favor true 
mayst thou ever find
Though little the brides 
of the giants he loves 
5
From the stall now 
one of thy wolves lead forth
And along with my boar 
shalt thou let him run
For slow my boar goes 
on the road of the gods
And I would not weary 
my worthy steed 
Hyndla spake
6
Falsely thou askest me 
Freyja to go
For so in the glance 
of thine eyes I see
On the way of the slain 
thy lover goes with thee
Ottar the young 
the son of Instein 
Freyja spake
7
Wild dreams methinks 
are thine when thou sayest
My lover is with me 
on the way of the slain
There shines the boar 
with bristles of gold
Hildisvini 
he who was made
By Dain and Nabbi 
the cunning dwarfs 
8
Now let us down 
from our saddles leap
And talk of the race 
of the heroes twain
The men who were born 
of the gods above
9
A wager have made 
in the foreign metal
Ottar the young 
and Angantyr
We must guard for the hero 
young to have
His fathers wealth 
the fruits of his race 
10
For me a shrine 
of stones he made
And now to glass 
the rock has grown
Oft with the blood 
of beasts was it red
In the goddesses ever 
did Ottar trust 
11
Tell to me now 
the ancient names
And the races of all 
that were born of old
Who are of the Skjoldungs 
who of the Skilfings
Who of the Othlings 
who of the Ylfings
Who are the freeborn 
who are the highborn
The noblest of men 
that in Mithgarth dwell 
Hyndla spake
12
Thou art Ottar 
the son of Instein
And Instein the son 
of Alf the Old
Alf of Ulf 
Ulf of Sæfari
And Sæfaris father 
was Svan the Red 
13
Thy mother bright 
with bracelets fair
Hight methinks 
the priestess Hledis
Frothi her father 
and Friaut her mother
Her race of the mightiest 
men must seem 
14
Of old the noblest 
of all was Ali
Before him Halfdan 
foremost of Skjoldungs
Famed were the battles 
the hero fought
To the corners of heaven 
his deeds were carried 
15
Strengthened by Eymund 
the strongest of men
Sigtrygg he slew 
with the icecold sword
His bride was Almveig 
the best of women
And eighteen boys 
did Almveig bear him 
16
Hence come the Skjoldungs 
hence the Skilfings
Hence the Othlings 
hence the Ynglings
Hence come the freeborn 
hence the highborn
The noblest of men 
that in Mithgarth dwell
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool 
17
Hildigun then 
her mother hight
The daughter of Svava 
and Sækonung
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool
It is much to know 
wilt thou hear yet more 
18
The mate of Dag 
was a mother of heroes
Thora who bore him 
the bravest of fighters
Frathmar and Gyrth 
and the Frekis twain
Am and Jofurmar 
Alf the Old
It is much to know 
wilt thou hear yet more 
19
Her husband was Ketil 
the heir of Klypp
He was of thy mother 
the mothersfather
Before the days 
of Kari was Frothi
And horn of Hild 
was Hoalf then 
20
Next was Nanna 
daughter of Nokkvi
Thy fathers kinsman 
her son became
Old is the line 
and longer still
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool 
21
Isolf and Osolf 
the sons of Olmoth
Whose wife was Skurhild 
the daughter of Skekkil
Count them among 
the heroes mighty
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool 
22
Gunnar the Bulwark 
Grim the Hardy
Thorir the Ironshield 
Ulf the Gaper 
Brodd and Hörvir 
both did I know
In the household they were 
of Hrolf the Old
23
Hervarth Hjorvarth 
Hrani Angantyr
Bui and Brami 
Barri and Reifnir
Tind and Tyrfing 
the Haddings twain
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool 
24
Eastward in Bolm 
were born of old
The sons of Arngrim 
and Eyfura
With berserktumult 
and baleful deed
Like fire oer land 
and sea they fared
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool 
25
The sons of Jormunrek 
all of yore
To the gods in death 
were as offerings given
He was kinsman of Sigurth 
hear well what I say
The foe of hosts 
and Fafnirs slayer 
26
From Volsungs seed 
was the hero sprung
And Hjordis was born 
of Hrauthungs race
And Eylimi 
from the Othlings came
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool 
27
Gunnar and Hogni 
the heirs of Gjuki
And Guthrun as well 
who their sister was
But Gotthorm was not 
of Gjukis race
Although the brother 
of both he was
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool
28
Of Hvethnas sons 
was Haki the best
And Hjorvarth the father 
of Hvethna was
29
Harald Battletooth 
of Auth was born
Hrörek the Ringgiver 
her husband was
Auth the Deepminded 
was Ivars daughter
But Rathbarth the father 
of Randver was
And all are thy kinsmen 
Ottar thou fool 
30
Eleven in number 
the gods were known
When Baldr oer the hill 
of death was bowed
And this to avenge 
was Vali swift
When his brothers slayer 
soon he slew 
31
The father of Baldr 
was the heir of Bur
32
Freyrs wife was Gerth 
the daughter of Gymir
Of the giants brood 
and Aurbotha bore her
To these as well 
was Thjazi kin
The darkloving giant 
his daughter was Skathi 
33
Much have I told thee 
and further will tell
There is much that I know 
wilt thou hear yet more 
34
Heith and Hrossthjof 
the children of Hrimnir
35
The sybils arose 
from Vitholfs race
From Vilmeith all 
the seers are
And the workers of charms 
are Svarthofthis children
And from Ymir sprang 
the giants all 
36
Much have I told thee 
and further will tell
There is much that I know 
wilt thou hear yet more 
37
One there was born 
in the bygone days
Of the race of the gods 
and great was his might
Nine giant women 
at the worlds edge
Once bore the man 
so mighty in arms 
38
Gjolp there bore him 
Greip there bore him
Eistla bore him 
and Eyrgjafa
Ulfrun bore him 
and Angeyja
Imth and Atla 
and Jarnsaxa
39
Strong was he made 
with the strength of earth
With the icecold sea 
and the blood of swine 
40
One there was born 
the best of all
And strong was he made 
with the strength of earth
The proudest is called 
the kinsman of men
Of the rulers all 
throughout the world 
41
Much have I told thee 
and further will tell
There is much that I know 
wilt thou hear yet more 
42
The wolf did Loki 
with Angrbotha win
And Sleipnir bore he 
to Svathilfari
The worst of marvels 
seemed the one
That sprang from the brother 
of Byleist then 
43
A heart ate Loki 
in the embers it lay
And halfcooked found he 
the womans heart
With child from the woman 
Lopt soon was
And thence among men 
came the monsters all 
44
The sea stormdriven 
seeks heaven itself
Oer the earth it flows 
the air grows sterile
Then follow the snows 
and the furious winds
For the gods are doomed 
and the end is death 
45
Then comes another 
a greater than all
Though never I dare 
his name to speak
Few are they now 
that farther can see
Than the moment when Othin 
shall meet the wolf 
Freyja spake
46
To my boar now bring 
the memorybeer
So that all thy words 
that well thou hast spoken
The third morn hence 
he may hold in mind
When their races Ottar 
and Angantyr tell 
Hyndla spake
47
Hence shalt thou fare 
for fain would I sleep
From me thou gettest 
few favors good
My noble one out 
in the night thou leapest
As Heithrun goes 
the goats among 
48
To Oth didst thou run 
who loved thee ever
And many under 
thy apron have crawled
My noble one out 
in the night thou leapest
As Heithrun goes 
the goats among 
Freyja spake
49
Around the giantess 
flames shall I raise
So that forth unburned 
thou mayst not fare 
Hyndla spake
50
Flames I see burning 
the earth is on fire
And each for his life 
the price must lose
Bring then to Ottar 
the draught of beer
Of venom full 
for an evil fate 
Freyja spake
51
Thine evil words 
shall work no ill
Though giantess bitter 
thy baleful threats
A drink full fair 
shall Ottar find
If of all the gods 
the favor I get
