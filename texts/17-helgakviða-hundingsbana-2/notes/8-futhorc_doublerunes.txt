Kiᛝ Sigmund ᚦe son of Volsuᛝ had as wife Borghild from Bralund
ᚦey named ᚦeir son Helgi after Helgi Hjorvarᚦsson
Hagal was Helgis foᛥerfaᚦer
Hundiᛝ was ᚦe name of a powerful kiᛝ
and Hundland is named from him
He was a mighty warrior and had many sons wiᚦ him on his campaigns
ᚦere was enmity and ᛥrife between ᚦese two Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ and Kiᛝ Sigmund
and ᛠch slew ᚦe oᚦers kinsmen
Kiᛝ Sigmund and his family were called Volsuᛝs and Ylfiᛝs
Helgi went as a spy to ᚦe home of Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ in disguise
Hᚫmiᛝ a son of Kiᛝ Hundiᛝs was at home
When Helgi went forᚦ ᚦen he met a youᛝ herdsman and said
1
Say to Hᚫmiᛝ
ᚦat Helgi knows
Whom ᚦe herᛟs
in armor hid
A gray wolf had ᚦey
wiᚦin ᚦeir hall
Whom Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ
Hamal ᚦought
Hamal was ᚦe name of Hagals son
Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ sent men to Hagal to seek Helgi
and Helgi could not save himself in any oᚦer way so he put on ᚦe cloᚦes of a bondwoman and set to work at ᚦe mill
ᚦey sought Helgi but found him not
2
ᚦen Blind spake out
ᚦe evilminded
Of Hagals bondwoman
bright are ᚦe eyes
Yon comes not of churls
who ᛥands at ᚦe quern
ᚦe millᛥones brᛠk
ᚦe boards are ᛲattered
3
ᚦe hero has
a dᛳm full hard
ᚦat barley now
he needs muᛥ grind
Better befits
his hand to feel
ᚦe hilt of ᚦe sword
ᚦan ᚦe millᛥones handle
Hagal answered and said
4
Small is ᚦe wonder
if boards are splintered
By a monarchs daughter
ᚦe mill is turned
Once ᚦrough clouds
ᛲe was wont to ride
And battles fought
like fightiᛝ men
Till Helgi a captive
held her faᛥ
Siᛥer ᛲe is
of Sigar and Hogni
ᚦus bright are ᚦe eyes
of ᚦe Ylfiᛝs maid
Helgi escaped and went to a fightiᛝ ᛲip
He slew Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ and ᚦenceforᚦ was called Helgi Hundiᛝsbane
He lay wiᚦ his hoᛥ in Brunavagar and ᚦey had ᚦere a ᛥrandslaughteriᛝ and ate ᚦe fleᛲ raw
Hogni was ᚦe name of a kiᛝ
His daughter was Sigrun
ᛲe was a Valkyrie and rode air and water
ᛲe was Svava reborn
Sigrun rode to Helgis ᛲip and said
5
Who rules ᚦe ᛲip
by ᚦe ᛲore so ᛥeep
Where is ᚦe home
ye warriors have
Why do ye bide
in Brunavagar
Or what ᚦe way
ᚦat ye wiᛲ to try
Helgi spake
6
Hamals ᚦe ᛲip
by ᚦe ᛲore so ᛥeep
Our home in Hlesey
do we have
For fair wind bide we
in Brunavagar
ᛠᛥward ᚦe way
ᚦat we wiᛲ to try
Sigrun spake
7
Where haᛥ ᚦou warrior
battle wakened
Or gorged ᚦe birds
of ᚦe siᛥers of Guᚦ
Why is ᚦy byrnie
spattered wiᚦ blᛳd
Why helmed doᛥ fᛠᛥ
on fᛳd uncᛳked
Helgi spake
8
Lateᛥ of all
ᚦe Ylfiᛝs son
On ᚦe weᛥern sᛠ
if know ᚦou wilt
Captured bᛠrs
in Bragalund
And fed ᚦe ᛠgles
wiᚦ edge of sword
Now is it ᛲown
why our ᛲirts are blᛳdy
And little our fᛳd
wiᚦ fire is cᛳked
Sigrun spake
9
Of battle ᚦou telleᛥ
and ᚦere was bent
Hundiᛝ ᚦe kiᛝ
before Helgi down
ᚦere was carnage when ᚦou
didᛥ aveᛝe ᚦy kin
And blᛳd flowed faᛥ
on ᚦe blade of ᚦe sword
Helgi spake
10
How didᛥ ᚦou know
ᚦat now our kin
Maiden wise
we have well aveᛝed
Many ᚦere are
of ᚦe sons of ᚦe mighty
Who ᛲare alike
our lofty race
Sigrun spake
11
Not far was I
from ᚦe lord of ᚦe folk
Yeᛥer morn
when ᚦe monarch was slain
ᚦough crafty ᚦe son
of Sigmund meᚦinks
When he spᛠks of ᚦe fight
in slaughterrunes
12
On ᚦe loᛝᛲip once
I saw ᚦee well
When in ᚦe blᛳdᛥained
bow ᚦou waᛥ
And round ᚦee icy
waves were ragiᛝ
Now would ᚦe hero
hide from me
But to Hognis daughter
is Helgi known
Granmar was ᚦe name of a mighty kiᛝ who dwelt at Svarins hill
He had many sons one was named Hoᚦbrodd anoᚦer Goᚦmund a ᚦird ᛥarkaᚦ
Hoᚦbrodd was in a kiᛝs meetiᛝ
and he won ᚦe promise of haviᛝ Sigrun Hognis daughter for his wife
But when ᛲe hᛠrd ᚦis ᛲe rode wiᚦ ᚦe Valkyries over air and sᛠ to seek Helgi
Helgi was ᚦen at Logafjoll and had fought wiᚦ Hundiᛝs sons
ᚦere he killed Alf and Eyolf Hjorvarᚦ and Hervarᚦ He was all wᛠry wiᚦ battle and sat under ᚦe ᛠgleᛥone
ᚦere Sigrun found him and ran to ᚦrow her arms about his neck and kissed him and told him her tidiᛝs as is set forᚦ in ᚦe old Volsuᛝ lay
13
Sigrun ᚦe joyful
chieftain sought
Forᚦwiᚦ Helgis

ᛲe greeted ᚦe hero
helmed and kissed him
ᚦe warriors hᛠrt
to ᚦe woman turned
14
From her hᛠrt ᚦe daughter
of Hogni spake
Dᛠr was Helgi
ᛲe said to her
Loᛝ wiᚦ all
my hᛠrt I loved
Sigmunds son
ere ever I saw him
15
At ᚦe meetiᛝ to Hoᚦbrodd
mated I was
But anoᚦer hero
I fain would have
ᚦough kiᛝ ᚦe wraᚦ
of my kin I fᛠr
Since I broke my faᚦers

Helgi spake
16
Fᛠr not ever
Hognis aᛝer
Nor yet ᚦy kinsmens

Maiden ᚦou

ᚦy kindred fair one

Helgi ᚦen assembled a grᛠt sᛠhoᛥ and went to Frekaᛥein On ᚦe sᛠ he met a perilous ᛥorm
lightniᛝ flaᛲed overhᛠd and ᚦe bolts ᛥruck ᚦe ᛲip
ᚦey saw in ᚦe air ᚦat nine Valkyries were ridiᛝ and recognized Sigrun amoᛝ ᚦem
ᚦen ᚦe ᛥorm abated and ᚦey came safe and sound to land
Granmars sons sat on a certain mountain as ᚦe ᛲips sailed toward ᚦe land
Goᚦmund lᛠped on a horse and rode for news to a promontory nᛠr ᚦe harbor
ᚦe Volsuᛝs were even ᚦen loweriᛝ ᚦeir sails
ᚦen Goᚦmund said as is written before in ᚦe Helgi lay
Who is ᚦe kiᛝ
who captains ᚦe fleet
And to ᚦe land
ᚦe warriors lᛠds
Sinfjotli Sigmunds son answered him and ᚦat tᛳ is written Goᚦmund rode home wiᚦ his tidiᛝs of ᚦe hoᛥ
ᚦen Granmars sons summoned an army
Many kiᛝs came ᚦere
ᚦere were Hogni Sigruns faᚦer and his sons Bragi and Dag
ᚦere was a grᛠt battle and all Granmars sons were slain and all ᚦeir allies only Dag Hognis son was spared and he swore loyalty to ᚦe Volsuᛝs
Sigrun went amoᛝ ᚦe dᛠd and found Hoᚦbrodd at ᚦe comiᛝ of dᛠᚦ ᛲe said
17
Never ᛲall Sigrun
from Sevafjoll
Hoᚦbrodd kiᛝ

Granmars sons
full cold have grown
And ᚦe giantᛥeeds gray
on corpses gorge
ᚦen ᛲe sought out Helgi and was full of joy
He said
18
Maid not fair

ᚦe Norris I blame
ᚦat ᚦis ᛲould be
ᚦis morn ᚦere fell

Bragi and Hogni

19
At Hlebjorg fell

Fighters more noble

when ᚦe hᛠd had fallen
20
On ᚦe ground full low
ᚦe slain are lyiᛝ
Moᛥ are ᚦere
of ᚦe men of ᚦy race
Nought haᛥ ᚦou won
for ᚦy fate it was
Brave men to briᛝ
to ᚦe battlefield
ᚦen Sigrun wept
Helgi said
21
Grieve not Sigrun
ᚦe battle is gained
ᚦe fighter can ᛲun not his fate
Sigrun spake
To life would I call
ᚦem who slaughtered lie
If safe on ᚦy brᛠᛥ I might be
ᚦis Goᚦmund ᚦe son of Granmar spoke
22
What hero grᛠt
is guidiᛝ ᚦe ᛲips
A golden flag
on ᚦe ᛥem he flies
I find not pᛠce
in ᚦe van of your fariᛝ
And round ᚦe fighters

Sinfjotli spake
23
Here may Hoᚦbrodd
Helgi find
ᚦe hater of flight
in ᚦe midᛥ of ᚦe fleet
ᚦe home of all
ᚦy race he has
And over ᚦe rᛠlm
of ᚦe fiᛲes he rules
Goᚦmund spake
24
Firᛥ ᛲall swords

Time is it Hoᚦbrodd
veᛝᛠnce to have
If in battle worᛥed

Sinfjotli spake
25
Better Goᚦmund
to tend ᚦe goats
And climb ᚦe rocks
of ᚦe mountain cliffs
A hazel switch
to hold in ᚦy hand
More seemly were
ᚦan ᚦe hilt of a sword
Helgi spake
26
Better Sinfjotli
ᚦee twould beseem
Battles to give
and ᛠgles to gladden
ᚦan vain and empty
speech to utter
ᚦough warriors oft
wiᚦ words do ᛥrive
27
Gᛳd I find not
ᚦe sons of Granmar
But for herᛟs tis seemly
ᚦe truᚦ to spᛠk
At Moinᛲeimar
proved ᚦe men
ᚦat hᛠrts for ᚦe wieldiᛝ
of swords ᚦey had
And ever brave
ᚦe warriors are
Helgi tᛳk Sigrun to wife and ᚦey had sons
Helgi did not rᛠch old age
Dag ᚦe son of Hogni offered sacrifice to Oᚦin to be aveᛝed for his faᚦers dᛠᚦ
Oᚦin gave Dag his spᛠr
Dag found Helgi his broᚦerinlaw at a place which is called Fjoturlund
He ᚦruᛥ ᚦe spᛠr ᚦrough Helgis body
ᚦen Helgi fell and Dag rode to Sevafjoll and told Sigrun ᚦe tidiᛝs

In ᚦe morn ᚦere fell

Sigrun spake
29
Now may every

Dag spake
33
Mad art ᚦou siᛥer

Such a curse

Oᚦin is ruler

Who sunders kin

34
ᚦy broᚦer riᛝs

Take half my land

Riᛝdecked maid

Sigrun spake
35
I ᛲall sit not happy

If ᚦe light cannot ᛲow

36
Such ᚦe fᛠr
ᚦat Helgis fᛟs
Ever felt
and all ᚦeir kin
As makes ᚦe goats

Run from ᚦe wolf

37
Helgi rose
above herᛟs all
Like ᚦe lofty aᛲ
above lowly ᚦorns
Or ᚦe noble ᛥag
wiᚦ dew besprinkled
Bᛠriᛝ his hᛠd
above all bᛠᛥs
And his horns glᛠm bright
to hᛠven itself
A hill was made in Helgis memory
And when he came to Valhall ᚦen Oᚦin bade him rule over every ᚦiᛝ wiᚦ himself
Helgi said
38
ᚦou ᛲalt Hundiᛝ

Waᛲ ᚦe feet

Tie up dogs
and tend ᚦe horses
And feed ᚦe swine

One of Sigruns maidens went one eveniᛝ to Helgis hill and saw ᚦat Helgi rode to ᚦe hill wiᚦ many men
ᚦe maiden said
39
Is ᚦis a drᛠm
ᚦat meᚦinks I see
Or ᚦe dᛳm of ᚦe gods
ᚦat dᛠd men ride
And hiᚦer spurriᛝ

Or is homecomiᛝ now

Helgi spake
40
No drᛠm is ᚦis
ᚦat ᚦou ᚦinkeᛥ to see
Nor ᚦe end of ᚦe world
ᚦough us ᚦou beholdeᛥ
And hiᚦer spurriᛝ
we urge our ᛥeeds
Nor is homecomiᛝ now
to ᚦe herᛟs granted
ᚦe maiden went home and said to Sigrun
41
Go forᚦ Sigrun
from Sevafjoll
If fain ᚦe lord
of ᚦe folk wouldᛥ find
ᚦe hill is open
Helgi is come
ᚦe swordtracks bleed
ᚦe monarch bade
ᚦat ᚦou his wounds
ᛲouldᛥ now make well
Sigrun went in ᚦe hill to Helgi and said
42
Now am I glad
of our meetiᛝ togeᚦer
As Oᚦins hawks
so ᛠger for prey
When slaughter and fleᛲ
all warm ᚦey scent
Or dewwet see
ᚦe red of day
43
Firᛥ will I kiss
ᚦe lifeless kiᛝ
Ere off ᚦe blᛳdy

Wiᚦ froᛥ ᚦy hair

And damp ᚦou art
wiᚦ ᚦe dew of dᛠᚦ
Icecold hands

What prince can I

Helgi spake
44
ᚦou alone Sigrun
of Sevafjoll
Art cause ᚦat Helgi
wiᚦ dew is hᛠvy
Golddecked maid
ᚦy tᛠrs are grievous
Sunbright souᚦmaid
ere ᚦou sleepeᛥ
ᛠch falls like blᛳd
on ᚦe heros brᛠᛥ
Burnedout cold
and cruᛲed wiᚦ care
45
Well ᛲall we drink

ᚦough love and lands

No man a soᛝ
of sorrow ᛲall siᛝ
ᚦough bleediᛝ wounds

Now in ᚦe hill
our brides we hold
ᚦe herᛟs loves
by ᚦeir husbands dᛠd
Sigrun made rᛠdy a bed in ᚦe hill
46
Here a bed
I have made for ᚦee Helgi
To reᛥ ᚦee from care
ᚦou kin of ᚦe Ylfiᛝs
I will make ᚦee sink
to sleep in my arms
As once I lay
wiᚦ ᚦe liviᛝ kiᛝ
Helgi spake
47
Now do I say
ᚦat in Sevafjoll
Aught may happen
ᛠrly or late
Since ᚦou sleepeᛥ clasped
in a corpses arms
So fair in ᚦe hill
ᚦe daughter of Hogni
Liviᛝ ᚦou comeᛥ

48
Now muᛥ I ride
ᚦe reddened ways
And my bay ᛥeed set

Weᛥward I go
to windhelms bridges
Ere Salgofnir wakes
ᚦe warrior ᚦroᛝ
ᚦen Helgi and his followers rode on ᚦeir way and ᚦe women went home to ᚦe dwelliᛝ
Anoᚦer eveniᛝ Sigrun bade ᚦe maiden keep watch at ᚦe hill
And at sunset when Sigrun came to ᚦe hill ᛲe said
49
Now were he come
if come he might
Sigmunds son
from Oᚦins sᛠt
Hope grows dim
of ᚦe heros return
When ᛠgles sit
on ᚦe aᛲtree boughs
And men are seekiᛝ
ᚦe meetiᛝ of drᛠms
ᚦe Maiden said
50
Mad ᚦou wouldᛥ seem
alone to seek
Daughter of herᛟs
ᚦe house of ᚦe dᛠd
For mightier now
at night are all
ᚦe ghoᛥs of ᚦe dᛠd
ᚦan when day is bright
Sigrun was ᛠrly dᛠd of sorrow and grief
It was believed in olden times ᚦat people were born again but ᚦat is now called old wives folly
Of Helgi and Sigrun it is said ᚦat ᚦey were born again
he became Helgi Haddiᛝjaskati and ᛲe Kara ᚦe daughter of Halfdan as is told in ᚦe Lay of Kara and ᛲe was a Valkyrie
