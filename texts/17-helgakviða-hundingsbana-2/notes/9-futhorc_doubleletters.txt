Kiᛝ Sigmund ᚦe son of Volsuᛝ had as wife Borghild from Bralund
ᚦey named ᚦeir son Helgi after Helgi Hjorvarᚦson
Hagal was Helgis foᛥerfaᚦer
Hundiᛝ was ᚦe name of a powerful kiᛝ
and Hundland is named from him
He was a mighty warior and had many sons wiᚦ him on his campaigns
ᚦere was enmity and ᛥrife betwen ᚦese two Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ and Kiᛝ Sigmund
and ᛠch slew ᚦe oᚦers kinsmen
Kiᛝ Sigmund and his family were caled Volsuᛝs and Ylfiᛝs
Helgi went as a spy to ᚦe home of Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ in disguise
Hᚫmiᛝ a son of Kiᛝ Hundiᛝs was at home
When Helgi went forᚦ ᚦen he met a youᛝ herdsman and said
1
Say to Hᚫmiᛝ
ᚦat Helgi knows
Whom ᚦe herᛟs
in armor hid
A gray wolf had ᚦey
wiᚦin ᚦeir hal
Whom Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ
Hamal ᚦought
Hamal was ᚦe name of Hagals son
Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ sent men to Hagal to sek Helgi
and Helgi could not save himself in any oᚦer way so he put on ᚦe cloᚦes of a bondwoman and set to work at ᚦe mil
ᚦey sought Helgi but found him not
2
ᚦen Blind spake out
ᚦe evilminded
Of Hagals bondwoman
bright are ᚦe eyes
Yon comes not of churls
who ᛥands at ᚦe quern

ᚦe hero has
a dᛳm ful hard
ᚦat barley now

Beter befits

Hagal answered and said
4
Smal is ᚦe wonder
if boards are splintered
By a monarchs daughter
ᚦe mil is turned
Once ᚦrough clouds
ᛲe was wont to ride
And batles fought
like fightiᛝ men
Til Helgi a captive
held her faᛥ
Siᛥer ᛲe is
of Sigar and Hogni
ᚦus bright are ᚦe eyes
of ᚦe Ylfiᛝs maid
Helgi escaped and went to a fightiᛝ ᛲip
He slew Kiᛝ Hundiᛝ and ᚦenceforᚦ was caled Helgi Hundiᛝsbane
He lay wiᚦ his hoᛥ in Brunavagar and ᚦey had ᚦere a ᛥrandslaughteriᛝ and ate ᚦe fleᛲ raw
Hogni was ᚦe name of a kiᛝ
His daughter was Sigrun
ᛲe was a Valkyrie and rode air and water

Sigrun rode to Helgis ᛲip and said
5
Who rules ᚦe ᛲip
by ᚦe ᛲore so ᛥep
Where is ᚦe home

Why do ye bide
in Brunavagar
Or what ᚦe way
ᚦat ye wiᛲ to try
Helgi spake
6
Hamals ᚦe ᛲip

Our home in Hlesey

For fair wind bide we

ᛠᛥward ᚦe way
ᚦat we wiᛲ to try
Sigrun spake
7
Where haᛥ ᚦou warior

Sigrun spake
9
Of batle ᚦou teleᛥ

Helgi spake
10
How didᛥ ᚦou know

But to Hognis daughter

Now were he come
