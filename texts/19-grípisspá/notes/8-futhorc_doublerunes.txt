Sigurᚦ spake
32
What sayᛥ ᚦou Gripir

Evil waits me

And gone is Sigurᚦs
wisdom gᛳd
If I ᛲall wᛳ

Gripir spake
37

Of ᛲape and form

Gripir spake
39

But mind and voice

Sigurᚦ spake
40
Moᛥ evil it seems

Gripir spake
43
ᚦe marriage draught

For Sigurᚦ and Gunnar

Your forms ye chaᛝe

But ᚦe mind of ᛠch
to himself remains
Sigurᚦ spake
44

To gᛳd amoᛝ us
Tell me Gripir
To Gunnar joy

Or happiness send

Gripir spake
45
ᚦine oaᚦs rememberiᛝ

And dwelleᛥ wiᚦ Guᚦrun

But Brynhild ᛲall deem

46
What may for ᚦe bride
requital be
ᚦe wife we won
wiᚦ subtle wiles
From me ᛲe has
ᚦe oaᚦs I made
And kept not loᛝ
ᚦey gladdened her little
Gripir spake
47
To Gunnar sᛳn

ᚦat ill didᛥ ᚦou
ᚦine oaᚦ fulfill
When ᚦe gᛳdly kiᛝ

Sigurᚦ spake
48
What sayᛥ ᚦou Gripir

Am I guilty so
as now is said
Or lies dᛟs ᚦe farfamed
queen put forᚦ
Of me and herself
Yet furᚦer spᛠk
Gripir spake
49
In wraᚦ and grief

No ᛲame ᚦou gaveᛥ
ᚦe gᛳdly one

Sigurᚦ spake
50
ᛲall Gunnar ᚦe wise

And Gotᚦorm and Hogni
ᚦen give heed
ᛲall Gjukis sons
now tell me Gripir
Redden ᚦeir blades

Gripir spake
51
Hᛠvy it lies

When her broᚦers all

Never again
ᛲall ᛲe happiness know

Sigurᚦ spake
52
Now fare ᚦee well

And well has Gripir
answered my wiᛲ
More of joy

Of my life to come
