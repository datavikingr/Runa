Gripir was the name of Eylimis son the brother of Hjordis
he ruled over lands and was of all men the wisest and most forwardseeing
Sigurth once was riding alone and came to Gripirs hall
Sigurth was easy to recognize
he found out in front of the hall a man
whose name was Geitir
Then Sigurth questioned him and asked
1
Who is it has
this dwelling here
Or what do men call
the peoples king
Geitir spake
Gripir the name
of the chieftain good
Who holds the folk
and the firmruled land
Sigurth spake
2
Is the king allknowing
now within
Will the monarch come
with me to speak
A man unknown
his counsel needs
And Gripir fain
I soon would find
Geitir spake
3
The ruler glad
of Geitir will ask
Who seeks with Gripir
speech to have
Sigurth spake
Sigurth am I
and Sigmunds son
And Hjordis the name
of the heros mother
4
Then Geitir went
and to Gripir spake
A stranger comes
and stands without
Lofty he is
to look upon
And prince thyself
he fain would see
5
From the hall the ruler
of heroes went
And greeted well
the warrior come
Sigurth welcome
long since had been thine
Now Geitir shalt thou
Grani take
6
Then of many
things they talked
When thus the men
so wise had met
Sigurth spake
To me if thou knowest
my mothers brother
Say what life
will Sigurths be
Gripir spake
7
Of men thou shalt be
on earth the mightiest
And higher famed
than all the heroes
Free of goldgiving
slow to flee
Noble to see
and sage in speech
Sigurth spake
8
Monarch wise
now more I ask
To Sigurth say
if thou thinkest to see
What first will chance
of my fortune fair
When hence I go
from out thy home
Gripir spake
9
First shalt thou prince
thy father avenge
And Eylimi
their ills requiting
The hardy sons
of Hunding thou
Soon shalt fell
and victory find
Sigurth spake
10
Noble king
my kinsman say
Thy meaning true
for our minds we speak
For Sigurth mighty
deeds dost see
The highest beneath
the heavens all
Gripir spake
11
The fiery dragon
alone thou shalt fight
That greedy lies
at Gnitaheith
Thou shalt be of Regin
and Fafnir both
The slayer truth
doth Gripir tell thee
Sigurth spake
12
Rich shall I be
if battles I win
With such as these
as now thou sayest
Forward look
and further tell
What the life
that I shall lead
Gripir spake
13
Fafnirs den
thou then shalt find
And all his treasure
fair shalt take
Gold shalt heap
on Granis back
And proved in fight
to Gjuki fare
Sigurth spake
14
To the warrior now
in words so wise
Monarch noble
more shalt tell
I am Gjukis guest
and thence I go
What the life
that I shall lead
Gripir spake
15
On the rocks there sleeps
the rulers daughter
Fair in armor
since Helgi fell
Thou shalt cut
with keenedged sword
And cleave the byrnie
with Fafnirs killer
Sigurth spake
16
The mailcoat is broken
the maiden speaks
The woman who
from sleep has wakened
What says the maid
to Sigurth then
That happy fate
to the hero brings
Gripir spake
17
Runes to the warrior
will she tell
All that men
may ever seek
And teach thee to speak
in all mens tongues
And life with health
thourt happy king
Sigurth spake
18
Now is it ended
the knowledge is won
And ready I am
forth thence to ride
Forward look
and further tell
What the life
that I shall lead
Gripir spake
19
Then to Heimirs
home thou comest
And glad shalt be
the guest of the king
Ended Sigurth
is all I see
No further aught
of Gripir ask
Sigurth spake
20
Sorrow brings me
the word thou sayest
For monarch forward
further thou seest
Sad the grief
for Sigurth thou knowest
Yet nought to me Gripir
known wilt make
Gripir spake
21
Before me lay
in clearest light
All of thy youth
for mine eyes to see
Not rightly can I
wise be called
Nor forwardseeing
my wisdom is fled
Sigurth spake
22
No man Gripir
on earth I know
Who sees the future
as far as thou
Hide thou nought
though hard it be
And base the deeds
that I shall do
Gripir spake
23
With baseness never
thy life is burdened
Hero noble
hold that sure
Lofty as long
as the world shall live
Battlebringer
thy name shall be
Sigurth spake
24
Nought could seem worse
but now must part
The prince and Sigurth
since so it is
My road I ask
the future lies open
Mighty one speak
my mothers brother
Gripir spake
25
Now to Sigurth
all shall I say
For to this the warrior
bends my will
Thou knowest well
that I will not lie
A day there is
when thy death is doomed
Sigurth spake
26
No scorn I know
for the noble king
But counsel good
from Gripir I seek
Well will I know
though evil awaits
What Sigurth may
before him see
Gripir spake
27
A maid in Heimirs
home there dwells
Brynhild her name
to men is known
Daughter of Buthli
the doughty king
And Heimir fosters
the fearless maid
Sigurth spake
28
What is it to me
though the maiden be
So fair and of Heimir
the fosterling is
Gripir truth
to me shalt tell
For all of fate
before me thou seest
Gripir spake
29
Of many a joy
the maiden robs thee
Fair to see
whom Heimir fosters
Sleep thou shalt find not
feuds thou shalt end not
Nor seek out men
if the maid thou seest not
Sigurth spake
30
What may be had
for Sigurths healing
Say now Gripir
if see thou canst
May I buy the maid
with the marriageprice
The daughter fair
of the chieftain famed
Gripir spake
31
Ye twain shall all
the oaths then swear
That bind full fast
few shall ye keep
One night when Gjukis
guest thou hast been
Will Heimirs fosterling
fade from thy mind
Sigurth spake
32
What sayst thou Gripir
give me the truth
Does fickleness hide
in the heros heart
Can it be that troth
I break with the maid
With her I believed
I loved so dear
Gripir spake
33
Tricked by another
prince thou art
And the price of Grimhilds
wiles thou must pay
Fain of thee
for the fairhaired maid
Her daughter she is
and she drags thee down
Sigurth spake
34
Might I with Gunnar
kinship make
And Guthrun win
to be my wife
Well the hero
wedded would be
If my treacherous deed
would trouble me not
Gripir spake
35
Wholly Grimhild
thy heart deceives
She will bid thee go
and Brynhild woo
For Gunnars wife
the lord of the Goths
And the princes mother
thy promise shall win
Sigurth spake
36
Evil waits me
well I see it
And gone is Sigurths
wisdom good
If I shall woo
for another to win
The maiden fair
that so fondly I loved
Gripir spake
37
Ye three shall
all the oaths then take
Gunnar and Hogni
and hero thou
Your forms ye shall change
as forth ye fare
Gunnar and thou
for Gripir lies not
Sigurth spake
38
How meanest thou
Why make we the change
Of shape and form
as forth we fare
There must follow
another falsehood
Grim in all ways
speak on Gripir
Gripir spake
39
The form of Gunnar
and shape thou gettest
But mind and voice
thine own remain
The hand of the fosterling
noble of Heimir
Now dost thou win
and none can prevent
Sigurth spake
40
Most evil it seems
and men will say
Base is Sigurth
that so he did
Not of my will shall
I cheat with wiles
The heroes maiden
whom noblest I hold
Gripir spake
41
Thou dwellest leader
lofty of men
With the maid as if
thy mother she were
Lofty as long
as the world shall live
Ruler of men
thy name shall remain
Sigurth spake
42
Shall Gunnar have
a goodly wife
Famed among men
speak forth now Gripir
Although at my side
three nights she slept
The warriors bride
Such neer has been
Gripir spake
43
The marriage draught
will be drunk for both
For Sigurth and Gunnar
in Gjukis hall
Your forms ye change
when home ye fare
But the mind of each
to himself remains
Sigurth spake
44
Shall the kinship new
thereafter come
To good among us
Tell me Gripir
To Gunnar joy
shall it later give
Or happiness send
for me myself
Gripir spake
45
Thine oaths remembering
silent thou art
And dwellest with Guthrun
in wedlock good
But Brynhild shall deem
she is badly mated
And wiles she seeks
herself to avenge
Sigurth spake
46
What may for the bride
requital be
The wife we won
with subtle wiles
From me she has
the oaths I made
And kept not long
they gladdened her little
Gripir spake
47
To Gunnar soon
his bride will say
That ill didst thou
thine oath fulfill
When the goodly king
the son of Gjuki
With all his heart
the hero trusted
Sigurth spake
48
What sayst thou Gripir
give me the truth
Am I guilty so
as now is said
Or lies does the farfamed
queen put forth
Of me and herself
Yet further speak
Gripir spake
49
In wrath and grief
full little good
The noble bride
shall work thee now
No shame thou gavest
the goodly one
Though the monarchs wife
with wiles didst cheat
Sigurth spake
50
Shall Gunnar the wise
to the womans words
And Gotthorm and Hogni
then give heed
Shall Gjukis sons
now tell me Gripir
Redden their blades
with their kinsmans blood
Gripir spake
51
Heavy it lies
on Guthruns heart
When her brothers all
shall bring thee death
Never again
shall she happiness know
The woman so fair
tis Grimhilds work
Sigurth spake
52
Now fare thee well
our fates we shun not
And well has Gripir
answered my wish
More of joy
to me wouldst tell
Of my life to come
if so thou couldst
Gripir spake
53
Ever remember
ruler of men
That fortune lies
in the heros life
A nobler man
shall never live
Beneath the sun
than Sigurth shall seem
