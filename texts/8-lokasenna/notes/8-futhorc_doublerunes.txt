ᚫgir who was also called Gymir had prepared ale for ᚦe gods after he had got ᚦe mighty kettle as now has been told
To ᚦis fᛠᛥ came Oᚦin and Frigg his wife
ᚦor came not as he was on a journey in ᚦe ᛠᛥ
Sif ᚦors wife was ᚦere and Bragi wiᚦ Iᚦun his wife
Tyr who had but one hand was ᚦere
ᚦe wolf Fenrir had bitten off his oᚦer hand when ᚦey had bound him
ᚦere were Njorᚦ and Skaᚦi his wife Freyr and Freyja and Viᚦar ᚦe son of Oᚦin
Loki was ᚦere and Freyrs servants Byggvir and Beyla
Many were ᚦere of ᚦe gods and elves
ᚫgir had two serviᛝmen Fimafeᛝ and Eldir
Glitteriᛝ gold ᚦey had in place of firelight
ᚦe ale came in of itself
and grᛠt was ᚦe pᛠce
ᚦe gueᛥs praised much ᚦe ability of ᚫgirs serviᛝmen
Loki might not endure ᚦat and he slew Fimafeᛝ
ᚦen ᚦe gods ᛲᛳk ᚦeir ᛲields and howled at Loki and drove him away to ᚦe foreᛥ and ᚦerᛠfter set to drinkiᛝ again
Loki turned back and outside he met Eldir
Loki spoke to him
1
Spᛠk now Eldir
for not one ᛥep
Farᚦer ᛲalt ᚦou fare
What aletalk here
do ᚦey have wiᚦin
ᚦe sons of ᚦe glorious gods
Eldir spake
2
Of ᚦeir wᛠpons ᚦey talk
and ᚦeir might in war
ᚦe sons of ᚦe glorious gods
From ᚦe gods and elves
who are gaᚦered here
No friend in words ᛲalt ᚦou find
Loki spake
3
In ᛲall I go
into ᚫgirs hall
For ᚦe fᛠᛥ I fain would see
Bale and hatred
I briᛝ to ᚦe gods
And ᚦeir mᛠd wiᚦ venom I mix
Eldir spake
4
If in ᚦou gᛟᛥ

And fain ᚦe fᛠᛥ wouldᛥ see
And wiᚦ slander and spite

ᚦink well leᛥ ᚦey wipe it on ᚦee
Loki spake
5
Beᚦink ᚦee Eldir
if ᚦou and I
ᛲall ᛥrive wiᚦ spiteful speech
Richer I grow
in rᛠdy words
If ᚦou spᛠkeᛥ tᛳ much to me
ᚦen Loki went into ᚦe hall
but when ᚦey who were ᚦere saw who had entered ᚦey were all silent
Loki spake
6
ᚦirᛥy I come
into ᚦis ᚦine hall
I Lopt from a journey loᛝ
To ask of ᚦe gods
ᚦat one ᛲould give
Fair mᛠd for a drink to me
7
Why sit ye silent
swollen wiᚦ pride
Ye gods and no answer give
At your fᛠᛥ a place
and a sᛠt prepare me
Or bid me forᚦ to fare
Bragi spake
8
A place and a sᛠt
will ᚦe gods prepare
No more in ᚦeir midᛥ for ᚦee
For ᚦe gods know well
what men ᚦey wiᛲ
To find at ᚦeir mighty fᛠᛥs
Loki spake
9
Remember Oᚦin
in olden days
ᚦat we boᚦ our blᛳd have mixed
ᚦen didᛥ ᚦou promise
no ale to pour
Unless it were brought for us boᚦ
Oᚦin spake
10
ᛥand forᚦ ᚦen Viᚦar
and let ᚦe wolfs faᚦer
Find a sᛠt at our fᛠᛥ
Leᛥ evil ᛲould Loki
spᛠk aloud
Here wiᚦin ᚫgirs hall
ᚦen Viᚦar arose and poured drink for Loki but before he drank he spoke to ᚦe gods
11
Hail to you gods
ye goddesses hail
Hail to ᚦe holy ᚦroᛝ
Save for ᚦe god
who yonder sits
Bragi ᚦere on ᚦe bench
Bragi spake
12
A horse and a sword
from my hoard will I give
And a riᛝ gives Bragi to bᛳt
ᚦat hatred ᚦou makᛥ not
amoᛝ ᚦe gods
So rouse not ᚦe grᛠt ones to wraᚦ
Loki spake
13
In horses and riᛝs
ᚦou ᛲalt never be rich
Bragi but boᚦ ᛲalt ᚦou lack
Of ᚦe gods and elves
here togeᚦer met
Lᛠᛥ brave in battle art ᚦou
And ᛲyeᛥ ᚦou art of ᚦe ᛲot
Bragi spake
14
Now were I wiᚦout
as I am wiᚦin
And here in ᚫgirs hall
ᚦine hᛠd would I bᛠr
in mine hands away
And pay ᚦee ᚦe price of ᚦy lies
Loki spake
15
In ᚦy sᛠt art ᚦou bold
not so are ᚦy deeds
Bragi adorner of benches
Go out and fight
if aᛝered ᚦou feeleᛥ
No hero such foreᚦought has
Iᚦun spake
16
Well priᚦee Bragi

Since chosen as wiᛲson he was
And spᛠk not to Loki
such words of spite
Here wiᚦin ᚫgirs hall
Loki spake
17
Be silent Iᚦun
ᚦou art I say
Of women moᛥ luᛥful in love
Since ᚦou ᚦy waᛲedbright

About ᚦy broᚦers slayer
Iᚦun spake
18
To Loki I spᛠk not

Here wiᚦin ᚫgirs hall
And Bragi I calm
who is hot wiᚦ beer
For I wiᛲ not ᚦat fierce ᚦey ᛲould fight
Gefjun spake
19
Why ye gods twain
wiᚦ bitter toᛝues
Raise hate amoᛝ us here
Loki is famed
for his mockery foul
And ᚦe dwellers in hᛠven he hates
Loki spake
20
Be silent Gefjun
for now ᛲall I say
Who led ᚦee to evil life
ᚦe boy so fair
gave a necklace bright
And about him ᚦy leg was laid
Oᚦin spake
21
Mad art ᚦou Loki
and little of wit
ᚦe wraᚦ of Gefjun to rouse
For ᚦe fate ᚦat is set
for all ᛲe sees
Even as I meᚦinks
Loki spake
22
Be silent Oᚦin

Oft gavᛥ ᚦou to him
who deserved not ᚦe gift
To ᚦe baser ᚦe battles prize
Oᚦin spake
23
ᚦough I gave to him
who deserved not ᚦe gift
To ᚦe baser ᚦe battles prize
Winters eight

Milkiᛝ ᚦe cows as a maid
Ay and babes didᛥ ᚦou bᛠr
Unmanly ᚦy soul muᛥ seem
Loki spake
24
ᚦey say ᚦat wiᚦ spells

Like witches wiᚦ charms didᛥ ᚦou work
And in witchs guise
amoᛝ men didᛥ ᚦou go
Unmanly ᚦy soul muᛥ seem
Frigg spake
25
Of ᚦe deeds ye two
of old have done
Ye ᛲould make no speech amoᛝ men
Whateer ye have done
in days gone by
Old tales ᛲould neer be told
Loki spake
26
Be silent Frigg
ᚦou art Fjorgyns wife
But ever luᛥful in love
For Vili and Ve
ᚦou wife of Viᚦrir
Boᚦ in ᚦy bosom have lain
Frigg spake
27
If a son like Baldr
were by me now
Here wiᚦin ᚫgirs hall
From ᚦe sons of ᚦe gods
ᚦou ᛲouldᛥ go not forᚦ
Till ᚦy fierceness in fight were tried
Loki spake
28
ᚦou wilt ᚦen Frigg
ᚦat furᚦer I tell
Of ᚦe ill ᚦat now I know
Mine is ᚦe blame
ᚦat Baldr no more
ᚦou seeᛥ ride home to ᚦe hall
Freyja spake
29
Mad art ᚦou Loki
ᚦat known ᚦou makeᛥ
ᚦe wroᛝ and ᛲame ᚦou haᛥ wrought
ᚦe fate of all
dᛟs Frigg know well
ᚦough herself ᛲe says it not
Loki spake
30
Be silent Freyja
for fully I know ᚦee
Sinless ᚦou art not ᚦyself
Of ᚦe gods and elves
who are gaᚦered here
ᛠch one as ᚦy lover has lain
Freyja spake
31
False is ᚦy toᛝue
and sᛳn ᛲalt ᚦou find
ᚦat it siᛝs ᚦee an evil soᛝ
ᚦe gods are wroᚦ
and ᚦe goddesses all
And in grief ᛲalt ᚦou homeward go
Loki spake
32
Be silent Freyja
ᚦou fouleᛥ witch
And ᛥeeped full sore in sin
In ᚦe arms of ᚦy broᚦer
ᚦe bright gods caught ᚦee
When Freyja her wind set free
Njorᚦ spake
33
Small ill dᛟs it work

A lord or a lover or boᚦ
But a wonder it is
ᚦat ᚦis womaniᛲ god
Comes hiᚦer ᚦough babes he has borne
Loki spake
34
Be silent Njorᚦ
ᚦou waᛥ ᛠᛥward sent
To ᚦe gods as a hoᛥage given
And ᚦe daughters of Hymir
ᚦeir privy had
When use did ᚦey make of ᚦy mouᚦ
Njorᚦ spake
35
Grᛠt was my gain
ᚦough loᛝ was I gone
To ᚦe gods as a hoᛥage given
ᚦe son did I have
whom no man hates
And foremoᛥ of gods is found
Loki spake
36
Give heed now Njorᚦ

No loᛝer I hold it hid
Wiᚦ ᚦy siᛥer hadᛥ ᚦou
so fair a son
ᚦus hadᛥ ᚦou no worse a hope
Tyr spake
37
Of ᚦe herᛟs brave

Here in ᚦe home of ᚦe gods
He harms not maids
nor ᚦe wives of men
And ᚦe bound from ᚦeir fetters he frees
Loki spake
38
Be silent Tyr
for between two men
Friendᛲip ᚦou neer couldᛥ faᛲion
Fain would I tell
how Fenrir once
ᚦy right hand rent from ᚦee
Tyr spake
39
My hand do I lack

And ᚦe loss briᛝs loᛝiᛝ to boᚦ
Ill fares ᚦe wolf
who ᛲall ever await
In fetters ᚦe fall of ᚦe gods
Loki spake
40
Be silent Tyr

ᚦy wife once chanced to win
Not a penny meᚦinks

Nor waᛥ righted an inch pᛳr wretch
Freyr spake

By ᚦe mouᚦ of ᚦe river

Till ᚦe gods to deᛥruction go
ᚦou tᛳ ᛲalt sᛳn

Be fettered ᚦou forger of ill
Loki spake
42
ᚦe daughter of Gymir

And sold ᚦy sword to bᛳt
But when Muspells sons
ᚦrough Myrkwᛳd ride
ᚦou ᛲalt wᛠponless wait pᛳr wretch
Byggvir spake
43
Had I birᚦ so famous

And sat in so lofty a sᛠt
I would cruᛲ to marrow
ᚦis croaker of ill
And bᛠt all his body to bits
Loki spake
44
What little crᛠture
gᛟs crawliᛝ ᚦere
Snuffliᛝ and snappiᛝ about
At Freyrs ᛠrs ever
wilt ᚦou be found
Or mutteriᛝ hard at ᚦe mill
Byggvir spake
45
Byggvir my name

As gods and men do grant
And here am I proud
ᚦat ᚦe children of Hropt
Togeᚦer all drink ale
Loki spake
46
Be silent Byggvir
ᚦou never couldᛥ set
ᚦeir ᛲares of ᚦe mᛠt for men
Hid in ᛥraw on ᚦe flᛳr

When herᛟs were fain to fight
Heimdall spake
47
Drunk art ᚦou Loki
and mad are ᚦy deeds
Why Loki lᛠvᛥ ᚦou ᚦis not
For drink beyond mᛠsure
will lᛠd all men
No ᚦought of ᚦeir toᛝues to take
Loki spake
48
Be silent Heimdall
in days loᛝ since
Was an evil fate for ᚦee fixed
Wiᚦ back held ᛥiff

As warder of hᛠven to watch
Skaᚦi spake
49
Light art ᚦou Loki

In freedom flouriᛲ ᚦy tail
On ᚦe rocks ᚦe gods bind ᚦee

Loki spake
50
ᚦough on rocks ᚦe gods bind me
wiᚦ bowels torn
Forᚦ from my froᛥcold son
I was firᛥ and laᛥ

ᚦere where ᚦjazi we caught
Skaᚦi spake

Wert ᚦou firᛥ and laᛥ

From my dwelliᛝs and fields

A counsel cold for ᚦee
Loki spake
52
More lightly ᚦou spakeᛥ

When ᚦou badᛥ me come to ᚦy bed
Such ᚦiᛝs muᛥ be known
if now we two
ᛲall seek our sins to tell
ᚦen Sif came forward and poured mᛠd for Loki in a cryᛥal cup and said
53
Hail tᛳ ᚦee Loki
and take ᚦou here
ᚦe cryᛥal cup of old mᛠd
For me at lᛠᛥ
alone of ᚦe gods
Blameless ᚦou knoweᛥ to be
He tᛳk ᚦe horn and drank ᚦerefrom
54
Alone ᚦou wert
if truly ᚦou wouldᛥ
All men so ᛲyly ᛲun
But one do I know
full well meᚦinks
Who had ᚦee from Hlorriᚦis arms
Loki ᚦe crafty in lies
Beyla spake
55
ᚦe mountains ᛲake
and surely I ᚦink
From his home comes Hlorriᚦi now
He will silence ᚦe man
who is slanderiᛝ here
Togeᚦer boᚦ gods and men
Loki spake
56
Be silent Beyla
ᚦou art Byggvirs wife
And deep art ᚦou ᛥeeped in sin
A grᛠter ᛲame

Befouled ᚦou art wiᚦ ᚦy filᚦ
ᚦen came ᚦor forᚦ and spake
57
Unmanly one cᛠse

And so ᛲall ᚦy life be loᛥ
Loki spake
58
Lo in has come
ᚦe son of ᛠrᚦ
Why ᚦrᛠten so loudly ᚦor
Less fierce ᚦou ᛲalt go

When he swallows Sigfaᚦer up
ᚦor spake
59
Unmanly one cᛠse

Loki spake

ᚦat ᚦou haᛥ fared

To men ᛲouldᛥ ᚦou say no more
In ᚦe ᚦumb of a glove

Unmanly one cᛠse

Loki spake
62Aloᛝ time ᛥill

ᚦough ᚦou ᚦrᛠteneᛥ ᚦus wiᚦ ᚦy hammer
Rough seemed ᚦe ᛥraps

Unmanly one cᛠse

Loki spake
64
I have said to ᚦe gods

But before ᚦee alone

For ᚦou fighteᛥ well I ween

He was bound wiᚦ ᚦe bowels of his son Vali but his son Narfi was chaᛝed to a wolf
Skaᚦi tᛳk a poisonsnake and faᛥened it up over Lokis face
