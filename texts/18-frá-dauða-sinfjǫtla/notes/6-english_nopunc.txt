Sigmund the son of Volsung was a king in the land of the Franks 
Sinfjotli was his eldest son the second was Helgi and the third Hamund 
Borghild Sigmunds wife had a brother who was named  
Sinfjotli her stepson and  both wooed the same woman wherefore Sinfjotli slew him 
And when he came home Borghild bade him depart but Sigmund offered her atonementmoney and this she had to accept 
At the funeral feast Borghild brought in ale 
she took poison a great horn full and brought it to Sinfjotli 
But when he looked into the horn he saw that it was poison and said to Sigmund 
Muddy is the drink Father 
Sigmund took the horn and drank therefrom 
It is said that Sigmund was so hardy that poison might not harm him either outside or in 
but all his sons could withstand poison only without on their skin 
Borghild bore another horn to Sinfjotli and bade him drink and all happened as before 
And yet a third time she brought him a horn and spoke therewith scornful words of him if he should not drink from it 
He spoke as before with Sigmund 
The latter said Let it trickle through your beard Son 
Sinfjotli drank and straight way was dead 
Sigmund bore him a long way in his arms and came to a narrow and long fjord and there was a little boat and a man in it 
He offered to take Sigmund across the fjord 
But when Sigmund had borne the corpse out into the boat then the craft was full 
The man told Sigmund to go round the inner end of the fjord 
Then the man pushed the boat off and disappeared 
King Sigmund dwelt long in Denmark in Borghilds kingdom after he had married her 
Thereafter Sigmund went south into the land of the Franks to the kingdom which he had there 
There he married Hjordis the daughter of King Eylimi 
their son was Sigurth 
King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of Hunding and Hjordis then married Alf the son of King Hjalprek 
There Sigurth grew up in his boyhood 
Sigmund and all his sons were far above all other men in might and stature and courage and every kind of ability 
Sigurth however was the fore most of all and all men call him in the old tales the noblest of mankind and the mightiest leader
