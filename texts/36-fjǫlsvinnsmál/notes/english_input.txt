17.
Before the house |
he beheld one coming
To the home of the giants high.
Svipdag spake:
"What giant is here, |
in front of the house,
And around him fires are flaming?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
18.
"What seekest thou here? |
for what is thy search?
What, friendless one, fain wouldst thou know?
By the ways so wet |
must thou wander hence,
For, weakling, no home hast thou here." 
Svipdag spake:
19.
"What giant is here, |
in front of the house,
To the wayfarer welcome denying?"
Fjolsvith spake:
"Greeting full fair |
thou never shalt find,
So hence shalt thou get thee home. 
20.
"Fjolsvith am I, |
and wise am I found,
But miserly am I with meat;
Thou never shalt enter |
within the house,--
Go forth like a wolf on thy way!" 
Svipdag spake:
21.
"Few from the joy |
of their eyes will go forth,
When the sight of their loves they seek;
Full bright are the gates |
of the golden hall,
And a home shall I here enjoy." 
Fjolsvith spake:
22.
"Tell me now, fellow, |
what father thou hast,
And the kindred of whom thou camst."
Svipdag spake:
"Vindkald am I, |
and Varkald's son,
And Fjolkald his father was. 
23.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
Who is it that holds |
and has for his own
The rule of the hall so rich?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
24.
"Mengloth is she, |
her mother bore her
To the son of Svafrthorin;
She is it that holds |
and has for her own
The rule of the hall so rich." 
Svipdag spake:
25.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What call they the gate? |
for among the gods
Ne'er saw man so grim a sight." 
Fjolsvith spake:
26.
"Thrymgjol they call it; |
'twas made by the three,
The sons of Solblindi;
And fast as a fetter |
the farer it holds,
Whoever shall lift the latch." 
Svipdag spake:
27.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What call they the house? |
for no man beheld
'Mongst the gods so grim a sight." 
Fjolsvith spake:
28.
"Gastropnir is it, |
of old I made it
From the limbs of Leirbrimir;
I braced it so strongly |
that fast it shall stand
So long as the world shall last." 
Svipdag spake:
29.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What call they the tree |
that casts abroad
Its limbs o'er every land?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
30.
"Mimameith its name, |
and no man knows
What root beneath it runs;
And few can guess |
what shall fell the tree,
For fire nor iron shall fell it."
Svipdag spake:
31.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What grows from the seed |
of the tree so great,
That fire nor iron shall fell?"
Fjolsvith spake:
32.
"Women, sick |
with child, shall seek
Its fruit to the flames to bear;
Then out shall come |
what within was hid,
And so is it mighty with men."
Svipdag spake:
33.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What cock is he |
on the highest bough,
That glitters all with gold?"
Fjolsvith spake:
34.
"Vithofnir his name, |
and now he shines
Like lightning on Mimameith's limbs;
And great is the trouble |
with which he grieves
Both Surt and Sinmora."
Svipdag spake:
35.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What call they the hounds, |
that before the house
So fierce and angry are?"
Fjolsvith spake:
36.
"Gif call they one, |
and Geri the other,
If now the truth thou wouldst know;
Great they are, |
and their might will grow,
Till the gods to death are doomed."
Svipdag spake:
37.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
May no man hope |
the house to enter,
While the hungry hounds are sleeping?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
38.
"Together they sleep not, |
for so was it fixed
When the guard to them was given;
One sleeps by night, |
the next by day,
So no man may enter ever."
Svipdag spake:
39.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
Is there no meat |
that men may give them,
And leap within while they eat?"
Fjolsvith spake:
40.
"Two wing-joints there be |
in Vithofnir's body,
If now the truth thou wouldst know;
That alone is the meat |
that men may give them,
And leap within while they eat." 
Svipdag spake:
41.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What weapon can send |
Vithofnir to seek
The house of Hel below?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
42.
"Lævatein is there, |
that Lopt with runes
Once made by the doors of death;
In Lægjarn's chest |
by Sinmora lies it,
And nine locks fasten it firm." 
Svipdag spake:
43.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
May a man come thence, |
who thither goes,
And tries the sword to take?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
44.
"Thence may he come |
who thither goes,
And tries the sword to take,
If with him he carries |
what few can win,
To give to the goddess of gold." 
Svipdag spake:
45.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What treasure is there |
that men may take
To rejoice the giantess pale?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
46.
"The sickle bright |
in thy wallet bear,
Mid Vithofnir's feathers found;
To Sinmora give it, |
and then shall she grant
That the weapon by thee be won." 
Svipdag spake:
47.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What call they the hall, |
encompassed here
With flickering magic flames?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
48.
"Lyr is it called, |
and long it shall
On the tip of a spear-point tremble;
Of the noble house |
mankind has heard,
But more has it never known." 
Svipdag spake:
49.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What one of the gods |
has made so great
The hall I behold within?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
50.
"Uni and Iri, |
Bari and Jari,
Var and Vegdrasil,
Dori and Ori, |
Delling, and there
Was Loki, the fear of the folk." 
Svipdag spake:
51.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What call they the mountain |
on which the maid
Is lying so lovely to see?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
52.
"Lyfjaberg is it, |
and long shall it be
A joy to the sick and the sore;
For well shall grow |
each woman who climbs it,
Though sick full long she has lain." 
Svipdag spake:
53.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
What maidens are they |
that at Mengloth's knees
Are sitting so gladly together?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
54.
"Hlif is one named, |
Hlifthrasa another,
Thjothvara call they the third;
Bjort and Bleik, |
Blith and Frith,
Eir and Aurbotha." 
Svipdag spake:
55.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
Aid bring they to all |
who offerings give,
If need be found therefor?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
56.
"Soon aid they all |
who offerings give
On the holy altars high;
And if danger they see |
for the sons of men,
Then each from ill do they guard." 
Svipdag spake:
57.
"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, |
the question I ask,
For now the truth would I know:
Lives there the man |
who in Mengloth's arms
So fair may seek to sleep?" 
Fjolsvith spake:
58.
"No man there is |
who in Mengloth's arms
So fair may seek to sleep,
Save Svipdag alone, |
for the sun-bright maid
Is destined his bride to be." 
Svipdag spake:
59.
"Fling back the gates! |
make the gateway wide!
Here mayst thou Svipdag see!
Hence get thee to find |
if gladness soon
Mengloth to me will give." 
Fjolsvith spake:
60.
"Hearken, Mengloth, |
a man is come;
Go thou the guest to see!
The hounds are fawning, |
the house bursts open,--
Svipdag, methinks, is there." 
Mengloth spake:
61.
"On the gallows high |
shall hungry ravens
Soon thine eyes pluck out,
If thou liest in saying |
that here at last
The hero is come to my hall. 
62.
"Whence camest thou hither? |
how camest thou here?
What name do thy kinsmen call thee?
Thy race and thy name |
as a sign must I know,
That thy bride I am destined to be." 
Svipdag spake:
63.
"Svipdag am I, |
and Solbjart's son;
Thence came I by wind-cold ways;
With the words of Urth |
shall no man war,
Though unearned her gifts be given." 
Mengloth spake:
64.
"Welcome thou art, |
for long have I waited;
The welcoming kiss shalt thou win!
For two who love |
is the longed-for meeting
The greatest gladness of all. 
65.
"Long have I sat |
on Lyfjaberg here,
Awaiting thee day by day;
And now I have |
what I ever hoped,
For here thou art come to my hall. 
66.
"Alike we yearned; |
I longed for thee,
And thou for my love hast longed;
But now henceforth |
together we know
Our lives to the end we shall live."
