ᚦe mᛳn knew not
what might was his
ᚦe ᛥars knew not
where ᚦeir ᛥations were
6
ᚦen sought ᚦe gods
ᚦeir asemblysᛠts

Of gold no lack

Huge of might

9
ᚦen sought ᚦe gods
ᚦeir asemblysᛠts
ᚦe holy ones

To find who ᛲould raise
ᚦe race of dwarfs
Out of Brimirs blᛳd

Oft and again

2
Heiᚦ ᚦey named her

To evil women
