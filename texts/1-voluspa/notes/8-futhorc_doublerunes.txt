Hᛠriᛝ I ask
from ᚦe holy races
From Heimdalls sons
boᚦ high and low
ᚦou wilt Valfaᚦer
ᚦat well I relate
Old tales I remember
of men loᛝ ago
2
I remember yet
ᚦe giants of yore
Who gave me brᛠd
in ᚦe days gone by
Nine worlds I knew
ᚦe nine in ᚦe tree
Wiᚦ mighty rᛳts
benᛠᚦ ᚦe mold
3
Of old was ᚦe age
when Ymir lived
Sᛠ nor cᛳl waves
nor sand ᚦere were
ᛠrᚦ had not been
nor hᛠven above
But a yawniᛝ gap
and grass nowhere
4
ᚦen Burs sons lifted
ᚦe level land
Miᚦgarᚦ ᚦe mighty
ᚦere ᚦey made
ᚦe sun from ᚦe souᚦ
warmed ᚦe ᛥones of ᛠrᚦ
And green was ᚦe ground
wiᚦ growiᛝ leeks
5
ᚦe sun ᚦe siᛥer
of ᚦe mᛳn from ᚦe souᚦ
Her right hand caᛥ
over hᛠvens rim
No knowledge ᛲe had
where her home ᛲould be
ᚦe mᛳn knew not
what might was his
ᚦe ᛥars knew not
where ᚦeir ᛥations were
6
ᚦen sought ᚦe gods
ᚦeir assemblysᛠts
ᚦe holy ones
and council held
Names ᚦen gave ᚦey
to nᛳn and twilight
Morniᛝ ᚦey named
and ᚦe waniᛝ mᛳn
Night and eveniᛝ
ᚦe yᛠrs to number
7
At Iᚦavoll met
ᚦe mighty gods
ᛲrines and temples
ᚦey timbered high
Forges ᚦey set and
ᚦey smiᚦied ore
Toᛝs ᚦey wrought
and tᛳls ᚦey faᛲioned
8
In ᚦeir dwelliᛝs at pᛠce
ᚦey played at tables
Of gold no lack
did ᚦe gods ᚦen know
Till ᚦiᚦer came
up giantmaids ᚦree
Huge of might
out of Jotunheim
9
ᚦen sought ᚦe gods
ᚦeir assemblysᛠts
ᚦe holy ones
and council held
To find who ᛲould raise
ᚦe race of dwarfs
Out of Brimirs blᛳd
and ᚦe legs of Blain
10
ᚦere was Motsognir
ᚦe mightieᛥ made
Of all ᚦe dwarfs
and Durin next
Many a likeness
of men ᚦey made
ᚦe dwarfs in ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
as Durin said
11
Nyi and Niᚦi
Norᚦri and Suᚦri
Auᛥri and Veᛥri

13
Fili Kili

Frar Hornbori
Frᚫg and Loni
Aurvaᛝ Jari
Eikinskjaldi
14
ᚦe race of ᚦe dwarfs
in Dvalins ᚦroᛝ
Down to Lofar
ᚦe liᛥ muᛥ I tell
ᚦe rocks ᚦey left
and ᚦrough wet lands
ᚦey sought a home
in ᚦe fields of sand
15
ᚦere were Draupnir
and Dolgᚦrasir
Hor Haugspori
Hlevaᛝ Gloin
Dori Ori
Duf Andvari
Skirfir Virfir
Skafiᚦ Ai
16 Alf and Yᛝvi
Eikinskjaldi
Fjalar and Froᛥi
Fiᚦ and Ginnar
So for all time
ᛲall ᚦe tale be known
ᚦe liᛥ of all
ᚦe forbᛠrs of Lofar
17
ᚦen from ᚦe ᚦroᛝ
did ᚦree come forᚦ
From ᚦe home of ᚦe gods
ᚦe mighty and gracious
Two wiᚦout fate
on ᚦe land ᚦey found
Ask and Embla
empty of might
18
Soul ᚦey had not
sense ᚦey had not
Hᛠt nor motion
nor gᛳdly hue
Soul gave Oᚦin
sense gave Hönir
Hᛠt gave Loᚦur
and gᛳdly hue
19
An aᛲ I know
Yggdrasil its name
Wiᚦ water white
is ᚦe grᛠt tree wet
ᚦence come ᚦe dews
ᚦat fall in ᚦe dales
Green by Urᚦs well
dᛟs it ever grow
20
ᚦence come ᚦe maidens
mighty in wisdom
ᚦree from ᚦe dwelliᛝ
down nᛠᚦ ᚦe tree
Urᚦ is one named
Verᚦandi ᚦe next
On ᚦe wᛳd ᚦey scored
and Skuld ᚦe ᚦird
Laws ᚦey made ᚦere
and life allotted
To ᚦe sons of men
and set ᚦeir fates
21
ᚦe war I remember
ᚦe firᛥ in ᚦe world
When ᚦe gods wiᚦ spᛠrs
had smitten Gollveig
And in ᚦe hall
of Hor had burned her
ᚦree times burned
and ᚦree times born
Oft and again
yet ever ᛲe lives
22
Heiᚦ ᚦey named her
who sought ᚦeir home
ᚦe wideseeiᛝ witch
in magic wise
Minds ᛲe bewitched
ᚦat were moved by her magic
To evil women
a joy ᛲe was
24
ᚦen sought ᚦe gods
ᚦeir assemblysᛠts
ᚦe holy ones
and council held
Wheᚦer ᚦe gods  ᛲould tribute give Or to all alike  ᛲould worᛲip beloᛝ
23
On ᚦe hoᛥ his spᛠr
did Oᚦin hurl
ᚦen in ᚦe world
did war firᛥ come
ᚦe wall ᚦat girdled
ᚦe gods was broken
And ᚦe field by ᚦe warlike
Wanes was trodden
24
ᚦen sought ᚦe gods
ᚦeir assemblysᛠts
ᚦe holy ones
and council held
Wheᚦer ᚦe gods  ᛲould tribute give Or to all alike  ᛲould worᛲip beloᛝ
25
ᚦen sought ᚦe gods
ᚦeir assemblysᛠts
ᚦe holy ones
and council held
To find who wiᚦ venom
ᚦe air had filled
Or had given Oᚦs bride
to ᚦe giants brᛳd
26
In swelliᛝ rage
ᚦen rose up ᚦor
Seldom he sits
when he such ᚦiᛝs hᛠrs
And ᚦe oaᚦs were broken
ᚦe words and bonds
ᚦe mighty pledges
between ᚦem made
27
I know of ᚦe horn
of Heimdall hidden
Under ᚦe highrᛠchiᛝ
holy tree
On it ᚦere pours
from Valfaᚦers pledge
A mighty ᛥrᛠm
would you know yet more
28
Alone I sat
when ᚦe Old One sought me
ᚦe terror of gods
and gazed in mine eyes
What haᛥ ᚦou to ask
why comeᛥ ᚦou hiᚦer
Oᚦin I know
where ᚦine eye is hidden”
29
I know where Oᚦins
eye is hidden
Deep in ᚦe widefamed
well of Mimir
Mᛠd from ᚦe pledge
of Oᚦin ᛠch mom
Dᛟs Mimir drink
would you know yet more
30
Necklaces had I
and riᛝs from Heerfaᚦer
Wise was my speech
and my magic wisdom
Widely I saw
over all ᚦe worlds
31
On all sides saw I
Valkyries assemble
Rᛠdy to ride
to ᚦe ranks of ᚦe gods
Skuld bore ᚦe ᛲield
and Skogul rode next
Guᚦ Hild Gondul
and Geirskogul
Of Herjans maidens
ᚦe liᛥ have ye hᛠrd
Valkyries rᛠdy
to ride ᛟr ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
32
I saw for Baldr
ᚦe bleediᛝ god
ᚦe son of Oᚦin
his deᛥiny set
Famous and fair
in ᚦe lofty fields
Full grown in ᛥreᛝᚦ
ᚦe miᛥletᛟ ᛥᛳd
33
From ᚦe branch which seemed
so slender and fair
Came a harmful ᛲaft
ᚦat Hoᚦ ᛲould hurl
But ᚦe broᚦer of Baldr
was born ere loᛝ
And one night old
fought Oᚦins son
34
His hands he waᛲed not
his hair he combed not
Till he bore to ᚦe baleblaze
Baldrs fᛟ
But in Fensalir
did Frigg weep sore
For Valhalls need
would you know yet more
35
One did I see
in ᚦe wet wᛳds bound
A lover of ill
and to Loki like
By his side dᛟs Sigyn
sit nor is glad
To see her mate
would you know yet more
36
From ᚦe ᛠᛥ ᚦere pours
ᚦrough poisoned vales
Wiᚦ swords and daggers
ᚦe river Sliᚦ
37
Norᚦward a hall
in Niᚦavellir
Of gold ᚦere rose
for Sindris race
And in Okolnir
anoᚦer ᛥᛳd
Where ᚦe giant Brimir
his beerhall had
38
A hall I saw
far from ᚦe sun
On Naᛥrond it ᛥands
and ᚦe dᛳrs face norᚦ
Venom drops
ᚦrough ᚦe smokevent down
For around ᚦe walls
do serpents wind
39
I saw ᚦere wadiᛝ
ᚦrough rivers wild
Trᛠcherous men
and murderers tᛳ
And workers of ill
wiᚦ ᚦe wives of men
ᚦere Niᚦhogg sucked
ᚦe blᛳd of ᚦe slain
And ᚦe wolf tore men
would you know yet more
40
ᚦe giantess old
in Ironwᛳd sat
In ᚦe ᛠᛥ and bore
ᚦe brᛳd of Fenrir
Amoᛝ ᚦese one
in monᛥers guise
Was sᛳn to ᛥᛠl
ᚦe sun from ᚦe sky
41
ᚦere feeds he full
on ᚦe fleᛲ of ᚦe dᛠd
And ᚦe home of ᚦe gods
he reddens wiᚦ gore
Dark grows ᚦe sun
and in summer sᛳn
Come mighty ᛥorms
would you know yet more
42
On a hill ᚦere sat
and smote on his harp
Eggᚦer ᚦe joyous
ᚦe giants warder
Above him ᚦe cock
in ᚦe birdwᛳd crowed
Fair and red
did Fjalar ᛥand
43
ᚦen to ᚦe gods
crowed Gollinkambi
He wakes ᚦe herᛟs
in Oᚦins hall
And benᛠᚦ ᚦe ᛠrᚦ

ᚦe ruᛥred bird
at ᚦe bars of Hel
44
Now Garm howls loud
before Gnipahellir
ᚦe fetters will burᛥ
and ᚦe wolf run free
Much do I know
and more can see
Of ᚦe fate of ᚦe gods
ᚦe mighty in fight
45
Broᚦers ᛲall fight
and fell ᛠch oᚦer
And siᛥers sons
ᛲall kinᛲip ᛥain
Hard is it on ᛠrᚦ
wiᚦ mighty whoredom
Axetime swordtime
ᛲields are sundered
Windtime wolftime
ere ᚦe world falls
Nor ever ᛲall men
ᛠch oᚦer spare
46
Faᛥ move ᚦe sons
of Mim and fate
Is hᛠrd in ᚦe note
of ᚦe Gjallarhorn
Loud blows Heimdall
ᚦe horn is aloft
In fᛠr quake all
who on Helroads are
47
Yggdrasil ᛲakes
and ᛲiver on high
ᚦe ancient limbs
and ᚦe giant is lᛳse
To ᚦe hᛠd of Mim
dᛟs Oᚦin give heed
But ᚦe kinsman of Surt
ᛲall slay him sᛳn
48
How fare ᚦe gods
how fare ᚦe elves
All Jotunheim groans
ᚦe gods are at council
Loud roar ᚦe dwarfs
by ᚦe dᛳrs of ᛥone
ᚦe maᛥers of ᚦe rocks
would you know yet more
49
Now Garm howls loud
before Gnipahellir
ᚦe fetters will burᛥ

Much do I know

50
From ᚦe ᛠᛥ comes Hrym

After ᚦe wolf

48
How fare ᚦe gods

All Jotunheim groans

Loud roar ᚦe dwarfs

52
Surt fares from ᚦe souᚦ
wiᚦ ᚦe scourge of branches
ᚦe sun of ᚦe battlegods
ᛲone from his sword
ᚦe crags are sundered

53
Now comes to Hlin

For ᚦere muᛥ fall

56
In aᛝer smites

Forᚦ from ᚦeir homes

Nine paces fares
ᚦe son of Fjorgyn
And slain by ᚦe serpent
fᛠrless he sinks
57
ᚦe sun turns black
ᛠrᚦ sinks in ᚦe sᛠ
ᚦe hot ᛥars down
from hᛠven are whirled
Fierce grows ᚦe ᛥᛠm
and ᚦe lifefeediᛝ flame
Till fire lᛠps high
about hᛠven itself
58
Now Garm howls loud
before Gnipahellir
ᚦe fetters will burᛥ
and ᚦe wolf run free
Much do I know

Of ᚦe fate of ᚦe gods

59
Now do I see

Rise all green

And fiᛲ he catches

60
ᚦe gods in Iᚦavoll

Of ᚦe terrible girdler
of ᛠrᚦ ᚦey talk
And ᚦe mighty paᛥ

And ᚦe ancient runes

61
In wondrous bᛠuty

ᛲall ᚦe golden tables
ᛥand mid ᚦe grass
Which ᚦe gods had owned

Baldr and Hoᚦ dwell
in Hropts battlehall
And ᚦe mighty gods

63
ᚦen Hönir wins
ᚦe prophetic wand
And ᚦe sons of ᚦe broᚦers
