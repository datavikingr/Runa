1.
I ask everyone to hear me,
High and low
of Heimdall's brood
You wanted this, Father of the Slain,
that I should tell you truly
Ancient tales I remember
of men long ago. 
2.
I remember yet
the giants of yore,
Who gave me bread
in the days gone by;
Nine worlds I knew,
the nine in the tree
With mighty roots
beneath the mold. 
3.
Of old was the age
when Ymir lived;
Sea nor cool waves
nor sand there were;
Earth had not been,
nor heaven above,
But a yawning gap,
and grass nowhere. 
4.
Then Bur's sons lifted
the level land,
Mithgarth the mighty
there they made;
The sun from the south
warmed the stones of earth,
And green was the ground
with growing leeks. 
5.
The sun, the sister
of the moon, from the south
Her right hand cast
over heaven's rim;
No knowledge she had
where her home should be,
The moon knew not
what might was his,
The stars knew not
where their stations were.
6.
Then sought the gods
their assembly-seats,
The holy ones,
and council held;
Names then gave they
to noon and twilight,
Morning they named,
and the waning moon,
Night and evening,
the years to number. 
7.
At Ithavoll met
the mighty gods,
Shrines and temples
they timbered high;
Forges they set, and
they smithied ore,
Tongs they wrought,
and tools they fashioned. 
8.
In their dwellings at peace
they played at tables,
Of gold no lack
did the gods then know,--
Till thither came
up giant-maids three,
Huge of might,
out of Jotunheim. 
9.
Then sought the gods
their assembly-seats,
The holy ones,
and council held,
To find who should raise
the race of dwarfs
Out of Brimir's blood
and the legs of Blain. 
10.
Then from the throng
did three come forth,
From the home of the gods,
the mighty and gracious;
Two without fate
on the land they found,
Ask and Embla,
empty of might. 
11.
Soul they had not,
sense they had not,
Heat nor motion,
nor goodly hue;
Soul gave Othin,
sense gave Hönir,
Heat gave Lothur
and goodly hue. 
12.
An ash I know,
Yggdrasil its name,
With water white
is the great tree wet;
Thence come the dews
that fall in the dales,
Green by Urth's well
does it ever grow. 
13.
Thence come the maidens
mighty in wisdom,
Three from the dwelling
down 'neath the tree;
Urth is one named,
Verthandi the next,
On the wood they scored,
and Skuld the third
Laws they made there,
and life allotted
To the sons of men,
and set their fates 
14.
The war I remember,
the first in the world,
When the gods with spears
had smitten Gollveig,
And in the hall
of Hor had burned her,
Three times burned,
and three times born,
Oft and again,
yet ever she lives. 
15.
Heith they named her
who sought their home,
The wide-seeing witch,
in magic wise;
Minds she bewitched
that were moved by her magic,
To evil women
a joy she was 
16.
Then sought the gods
their assembly-seats,
The holy ones,
and council held,
Whether the gods
should tribute give, 
Or to all alike
should worship belong.
17.
On the host his spear
did Odin hurl,
Then in the world
did war first come;
The wall that girdled
the gods was broken,
And the field by the warlike
Vanir was trodden.
18.
Then sought the gods
their assembly-seats,
The holy ones,
and council held,
To find who with venom
the air had filled,
Or had given Oth's bride
to the giants' brood. 
19.
In swelling rage
then rose up Thor,
Seldom he sits
when he such things hears,
And the oaths were broken,
the words and bonds,
The mighty pledges
between them made. 
20.
I know of the horn
of Heimdall, hidden
Under the high-reaching
holy tree;
On it there pours
from Valfather's pledge
A mighty stream:
would you know yet more? 
21.
Alone I sat
when the Old One sought me,
The terror of gods,
and gazed in mine eyes:
“What hast thou to ask?
why comest thou hither?
Odin, I know
where thine eye is hidden.”
22.
Deep in the wide-famed
well of Mimir;
Mead from the pledge
of Othin each mom
Does Mimir drink:
would you know yet more? 
23.
Necklaces had I
and rings from Heerfather,
Wise was my speech
and my magic wisdom;
Widely I saw
over all the worlds. 
24.
On all sides saw I
Valkyries assemble,
Ready to ride
to the ranks of the gods;
25.
I saw for Baldr,
the bleeding god,
The son of Othin,
his destiny set:
Famous and fair
in the lofty fields,
Full grown in strength
the mistletoe stood. 
26.
From the branch which seemed
so slender and fair
Came a harmful shaft
that Hoth should hurl;
But the brother of Baldr
was born ere long,
And one night old
fought Odin's son.
27.
His hands he washed not,
his hair he combed not,
Till he bore to the bale-blaze
Baldr's foe
But in Fensalir
did Frigg weep sore
For Valhall's need:
would you know yet more? 
28.
One did I see
in the wet woods bound,
A lover of ill,
and to Loki like;
By his side does Sigyn
sit, nor is glad
To see her mate:
would you know yet more? 
29.
From the east there pours
through poisoned vales
With swords and daggers
the river Slith. 
30.
Northward a hall
in Nithavellir
Of gold there rose
for Sindri's race;
And in Okolnir
another stood,
Where the giant Brimir
his beer-hall had. 
31.
A hall I saw,
far from the sun,
On Nastrond it stands,
and the doors face north,
Venom drops
through the smoke-vent down,
For around the walls
do serpents wind. 
32.
I saw there wading
through rivers wild
Treacherous men
and murderers too,
And workers of ill
with the wives of men;
There Nithhogg sucked
the blood of the slain,
And the wolf tore men;
would you know yet more? 
33.
The giantess old
in Ironwood sat,
In the east, and bore
the brood of Fenrir;
Among these one
in monster's guise
Was soon to steal
the sun from the sky. 
34.
There feeds he full
on the flesh of the dead,
And the home of the gods
he reddens with gore;
Dark grows the sun,
and in summer soon
Come mighty storms:
would you know yet more? 
35.
On a hill there sat,
and smote on his harp,
Eggther the joyous,
the giants' warder;
Above him the cock
in the bird-wood crowed,
Fair and red
did Fjalar stand. 
36.
Then to the gods
crowed Gollinkambi,
He wakes the heroes
in Othin's hall;
And beneath the earth
does another crow,
The rust-red bird
at the bars of Hel. 
37.
Now Garm howls loud
before Gnipahellir,
The fetters will burst,
and the wolf run free;
Much do I know,
and more can see
Of the fate of the gods,
the mighty in fight. 
38.
Brothers shall fight
and fell each other,
And sisters' sons
shall kinship stain;
Hard is it on earth,
with mighty whoredom;
Axe-time, sword-time,
shields are sundered,
Wind-time, wolf-time,
ere the world falls;
Nor ever shall men
each other spare. 
39.
Gjallarhorn
that Heimdall blows
horn held aloft
Odin consulting
with Mimir's head
47.
Yggdrasil shakes,
and shiver on high
The ancient limbs,
and the giant is loose;
To the head of Mim
does Othin give heed,
But the kinsman of Surt
shall slay him soon. 
48.
How fare the gods?
how fare the elves?
All Jotunheim groans,
the gods are at council;
Loud roar the dwarfs
by the doors of stone,
The masters of the rocks:
would you know yet more? 
49.
Now Garm howls loud
before Gnipahellir,
The fetters will burst,
and the wolf run free
Much do I know,
and more can see
Of the fate of the gods,
the mighty in fight. 
50.
From the east comes Hrym
with shield held high;
In giant-wrath
does the serpent writhe;
O'er the waves he twists,
and the tawny eagle
Gnaws corpses screaming;
Naglfar is loose. 
51.
O'er the sea from the north
there sails a ship
With the people of Hel,
at the helm stands Loki;
After the wolf
do wild men follow,
And with them the brother
of Byleist goes 
{48.
How fare the gods?
how fare the elves?
All Jotunheim groans,
the gods are at council;
Loud roar the dwarfs
by the doors of stone,
The masters of the rocks: |
would you know yet more?} 
52.
Surt fares from the south |
with the scourge of branches,
The sun of the battle-gods |
shone from his sword;
The crags are sundered, |
the giant-women sink,
The dead throng Hel-way, |
and heaven is cloven. 
Vǫl translated by Henry Adams Bellows, 1936 - translated by Henry Adams Bellows, 1936
53.
Now comes to Hlin |
yet another hurt,
When Othin fares |
to fight with the wolf,
And Beli's fair slayer |
seeks out Surt,
For there must fall |
the joy of Frigg 
.

Then comes Sigfather's |
mighty son,
Vithar, to fight |
with the foaming wolf;
In the giant's son |
does he thrust his sword
Full to the heart: |
his father is avenged. 
55.
Hither there comes |
the son of Hlothyn,
The bright snake gapes |
to heaven above;
Against the serpent |
goes Othin's son
56.
In anger smites |
the warder of earth,--
Forth from their homes |
must all men flee;-
Nine paces fares |
the son of Fjorgyn,
And, slain by the serpent, |
fearless he sinks. 
57.
The sun turns black, |
earth sinks in the sea,
The hot stars down |
from heaven are whirled;
Fierce grows the steam |
and the life-feeding flame,
Till fire leaps high |
about heaven itself. 
58.
Now Garm howls loud |
before Gnipahellir,
The fetters will burst, |
and the wolf run free;
Much do I know, |
and more can see
Of the fate of the gods, |
the mighty in fight. 
59.
Now do I see |
the earth anew
Rise all green |
from the waves again;
The cataracts fall, |
and the eagle flies,
And fish he catches |
beneath the cliffs. 
60.
The gods in Ithavoll |
meet together,
Of the terrible girdler |
of earth they talk,
And the mighty past |
they call to mind,
And the ancient runes |
of the Ruler of Gods. 
61.
In wondrous beauty |
once again
Shall the golden tables |
stand mid the grass,
Which the gods had owned |
in the days of old,
 
62.
Then fields unsowed |
bear ripened fruit,
All ills grow better, |
and Baldr comes back;
Baldr and Hoth dwell |
in Hropt's battle-hall,
And the mighty gods: |
would you know yet more? 
63.
Then Hönir wins |
the prophetic wand,
And the sons of the brothers |
of Tveggi abide
In Vindheim now: |
would you know yet more? 
64.
More fair than the sun, 
a hall I see,
Roofed with gold, 
on Gimle it stands;
There shall the righteous 
rulers dwell,
And happiness ever 
there shall they have. 
65.
There comes on high, 
all power to hold,
A mighty lord, 
all lands he rules. 
66.
From below the dragon 
dark comes forth,
Nithhogg flying 
from Nithafjoll;
The bodies of men on 
his wings he bears,
The serpent bright: 
but now must I sink.
