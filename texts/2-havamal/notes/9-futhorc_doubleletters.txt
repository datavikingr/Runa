Wiᚦin ᚦe gates
ere a man ᛲal go
Ful warily let him watch
Ful loᛝ let him lᛳk about him
For litle he knows
where a fᛟ may lurk
And sit in ᚦe sᛠts wiᚦin
2
Hail to ᚦe giver
a gueᛥ has come
Where ᛲal ᚦe ᛥraᛝer sit
Swift ᛲal he be
who wiᚦ swords ᛲal try
ᚦe prᛳf of his might to make
3
Fire he neds
who wiᚦ frozen knes
Has come from ᚦe cold wiᚦout
Fᛳd and cloᚦes
muᛥ ᚦe farer have
ᚦe man from ᚦe mountains come
4
Water and towels
and welcomiᛝ spech
ᛲould he find who comes to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
If renown he would get
and again be greted
Wisely and wel muᛥ he act
5
Wits muᛥ he have
who wanders wide
But al is ᛠsy at home
At ᚦe witles man
ᚦe wise ᛲal wink
When amoᛝ such men he sits
6
A man ᛲal not boaᛥ
of his kenes of mind
But kep it close in his brᛠᛥ
To ᚦe silent and wise
dᛟs il come seldom
When he gᛟs as gueᛥ to a house
For a faᛥer friend
one never finds
ᚦan wisdom tried and true
7
ᚦe knowiᛝ gueᛥ
who gᛟs to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
In silent atention sits
Wiᚦ his ᛠrs he hᛠrs
wiᚦ his eyes he watches
ᚦus wary are wise men al
8
Hapy ᚦe one
who wins for himself
Favor and praises fair
Les safe by far
is ᚦe wisdom found
ᚦat is hid in anoᚦers hᛠrt
9
Hapy ᚦe man
who has while he lives
Wisdom and praise as wel
For evil counsel
a man ful oft
Has from anoᚦers hᛠrt
10
A beter burden
may no man bᛠr
For wanderiᛝs wide ᚦan wisdom
It is beter ᚦan wᛠlᚦ
on unknown ways
And in grief a refuge it gives
1
A beter burden
may no man bᛠr
For wanderiᛝs wide ᚦan wisdom
Worse fᛳd for ᚦe journey
he briᛝs not afield
ᚦan an overdrinkiᛝ of ale
12
Les gᛳd ᚦere lies
ᚦan moᛥ believe
In ale for mortal men
For ᚦe more he drinks
ᚦe les dᛟs man
Of his mind ᚦe maᛥery hold
13
Over ber ᚦe bird
of forgetfulnes brᛳds
And ᛥᛠls ᚦe minds of men
Wiᚦ ᚦe herons fᛠᚦers
fetered I lay
And in Gunloᚦs house was held
14
Drunk I was
I was dᛠdrunk
When wiᚦ Fjalar wise I was
Tis ᚦe beᛥ of drinkiᛝ
if back one briᛝs
His wisdom wiᚦ him home
15
ᚦe son of a kiᛝ
ᛲal be silent and wise
And bold in batle as wel
Bravely and gladly
a man ᛲal go
Til ᚦe day of his dᛠᚦ is come
16
ᚦe slugard believes
he ᛲal live forever
If ᚦe fight he faces not
But age ᛲal not grant him
ᚦe gift of pᛠce
ᚦough spᛠrs may spare his life
17
ᚦe fᛳl is agape
when he comes to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
He ᛥamers or else is ᛥil
But sᛳn if he gets
a drink is it sen
What ᚦe mind of ᚦe man is like
18
He alone is aware
who has wandered wide
And far abroad has fared
How grᛠt a mind
is guided by him
ᚦat wᛠlᚦ of wisdom has
19
ᛲun not ᚦe mᛠd
but drink in mᛠsure
Spᛠk to ᚦe point or be ᛥil
For rudenes none
ᛲal rightly blame ᚦe
If sᛳn ᚦy bed ᚦou sekeᛥ
20
ᚦe gredy man
if his mind be vague
Wil ᛠt til sick he is
ᚦe vulgar man
when amoᛝ ᚦe wise
To scorn by his bely is brought
21
ᚦe herds know wel
when home ᚦey ᛲal fare
And ᚦen from ᚦe gras ᚦey go
But ᚦe fᛳliᛲ man
his belys mᛠsure
ᛲal never know aright
2
A paltry man
and pᛳr of mind
At al ᚦiᛝs ever mocks
For never he knows
what he ought to know
ᚦat he is not fre from faults
23
ᚦe witles man
is awake al night
ᚦinkiᛝ of many ᚦiᛝs
Careworn he is
when ᚦe morniᛝ comes
And his wᛟ is juᛥ as it was
24
ᚦe fᛳliᛲ man
for friends al ᚦose
Who laugh at him wil hold
When amoᛝ ᚦe wise
he marks it not
ᚦough hatred of him ᚦey spᛠk
25
ᚦe fᛳliᛲ man
for friends al ᚦose
Who laugh at him wil hold
But ᚦe truᚦ when he comes
to ᚦe council he lᛠrns
ᚦat few in his favor wil spᛠk
26
An ignorant man
ᚦinks ᚦat al he knows
When he sits by himself in a corner
But never what answer
to make he knows
When oᚦers wiᚦ queᛥions come
27
A witles man
when he mets wiᚦ men
Had beᛥ in silence abide
For no one ᛲal find
ᚦat noᚦiᛝ he knows
If his mouᚦ is not open tᛳ much
But a man knows not
if noᚦiᛝ he knows
When his mouᚦ has ben open tᛳ much
28
Wise ᛲal he sem
who wel can queᛥion
And also answer wel
Nought is concᛠled
ᚦat men may say
Amoᛝ ᚦe sons of men
29
Often he spᛠks
who never is ᛥil
Wiᚦ words ᚦat win no faiᚦ
ᚦe babliᛝ toᛝue
if a bridle it find not
Oft for itself siᛝs il
30
In mockery no one
a man ᛲal hold
Alᚦough he fare to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
Wise sems one oft
if nought he is asked
And safely he sits dryskined
31
Wise a gueᛥ holds it
to take to his hels
When mock of anoᚦer he makes
But litle he knows
who laughs at ᚦe fᛠᛥ
ᚦough he mocks in ᚦe midᛥ of his fᛟs
32
Friendly of mind
are many men
Til fᛠᛥiᛝ ᚦey mock at ᚦeir friends
To mankind a bane
muᛥ it ever be
When gueᛥs togeᚦer ᛥrive
3
Oft ᛲould one make
an ᛠrly mᛠl
Nor faᛥiᛝ come to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
Else he sits and chews
as if he would choke
And litle is able to ask
34
Crᛳked and far
is ᚦe road to a fᛟ
ᚦough his house on ᚦe highway be
But wide and ᛥraight
is ᚦe way to a friend
ᚦough far away he fare
35
Forᚦ ᛲal one go
nor ᛥay as a gueᛥ
In a siᛝle spot forever
Love becomes loaᚦiᛝ
if loᛝ one sits
By ᚦe hᛠrᚦ in anoᚦers home
36
Beter a house
ᚦough a hut it be
A man is maᛥer at home
A pair of goats
and a patchedup rᛳf
Are beter far ᚦan begiᛝ
37
Beter a house
ᚦough a hut it be
A man is maᛥer at home
His hᛠrt is blediᛝ
who neds muᛥ beg
When fᛳd he fain would have
38
Away from his arms
in ᚦe open field
A man ᛲould fare not a fᛳt
For never he knows
when ᚦe ned for a spᛠr
ᛲal arise on ᚦe diᛥant road
39
If wᛠlᚦ a man
has won for himself
Let him never sufer in ned
Oft he saves for a fᛟ
what he plans for a friend
For much gᛟs worse ᚦan we wiᛲ
40
None so fre wiᚦ gifts
or fᛳd have I found
ᚦat gladly he tᛳk not a gift
Nor one who so widely
scatered his wᛠlᚦ
ᚦat of recompense hatred he had
41
Friends ᛲal gladen ᛠch oᚦer
wiᚦ arms and garments
As ᛠch for himself can se
Giftgivers friendᛲips
are loᛝeᛥ found
If fair ᚦeir fates may be
42
To his friend a man
a friend ᛲal prove
And gifts wiᚦ gifts requite
But men ᛲal mockiᛝ
wiᚦ mockery answer
And fraud wiᚦ falsehᛳd met
43
To his friend a man
a friend ᛲal prove
To him and ᚦe friend of his friend
But never a man
ᛲal friendᛲip make
Wiᚦ one of his fᛟmans friends
4
If a friend ᚦou haᛥ
whom ᚦou fuly wilt truᛥ
And gᛳd from him wouldᛥ get
ᚦy ᚦoughts wiᚦ his miᛝle
and gifts ᛲalt ᚦou make
And fare to find him oft
45
If anoᚦer ᚦou haᛥ
whom ᚦou hardly wilt truᛥ
Yet gᛳd from him wouldᛥ get
ᚦou ᛲalt spᛠk him fair
but falsely ᚦink
And fraud wiᚦ falsehᛳd requite
46
So is it wiᚦ him
whom ᚦou hardly wilt truᛥ
And whose mind ᚦou mayᛥ not know
Laugh wiᚦ him mayᛥ ᚦou
but spᛠk not ᚦy mind
Like gifts to his ᛲalt ᚦou give
47
Youᛝ was I once
and wandered alone
And nought of ᚦe road I knew
Rich did I fel
when a comrade I found
For man is mans delight
48
ᚦe lives of ᚦe brave
and noble are beᛥ
Sorows ᚦey seldom fed
But ᚦe coward fᛠr
of al ᚦiᛝs fels
And not gladly ᚦe nigard gives
49
My garments once
in a field I gave
To a pair of carven poles
Herᛟs ᚦey semed
when cloᚦes ᚦey had
But ᚦe naked man is nought
50
On ᚦe hilside drᛠr
ᚦe firtre dies
Al bᛳtles its nedles and bark
It is like a man
whom no one loves
Why ᛲould his life be loᛝ
51
Hoter ᚦan fire
betwen false friends
Dᛟs friendᛲip five days burn
When ᚦe sixᚦ day comes
ᚦe fire cᛳls
And ended is al ᚦe love
52
No grᛠt ᚦiᛝ neds
a man to give
Oft litle wil purchase praise
Wiᚦ half a loaf
and a halfiled cup
A friend ful faᛥ I made
53
A litle sand
has a litle sᛠ
And smal are ᚦe minds of men
ᚦough al men are not
equal in wisdom
Yet halfwise only are al
54
A mᛠsure of wisdom
ᛠch man ᛲal have
But never tᛳ much let him know
ᚦe faireᛥ lives
do ᚦose men live
Whose wisdom wide has grown
5
A mᛠsure of wisdom
ᛠch man ᛲal have
But never tᛳ much let him know
For ᚦe wise mans hᛠrt
is seldom hapy
If wisdom tᛳ grᛠt he has won
56
A mᛠsure of wisdom
ᛠch man ᛲal have
But never tᛳ much let him know
Let no man ᚦe fate
before him se
For so is he freᛥ from sorow
57
A brand from a brand
is kindled and burned
And fire from fire begoten
And man by his spech
is known to men
And ᚦe ᛥupid by ᚦeir ᛥilnes
58
He muᛥ ᛠrly go forᚦ
who fain ᚦe blᛳd
Or ᚦe gᛳds of anoᚦer would get
ᚦe wolf ᚦat lies idle
ᛲal win litle mᛠt
Or ᚦe slepiᛝ man suces
59
He muᛥ ᛠrly go forᚦ
whose workers are few
Himself his work to sek
Much remains undone
for ᚦe morniᛝsleper
For ᚦe swift is wᛠlᚦ half won
60
Of sᛠsoned ᛲiᛝles
and ᛥrips of bark
For ᚦe ᚦatch let one know his ned
And how much of wᛳd
he muᛥ have for a monᚦ
Or in half a yᛠr he wil use
61
Waᛲed and fed
to ᚦe council fare
But care not tᛳ much for ᚦy cloᚦes
Let none be aᛲamed
of his ᛲᛟs and hose
Les ᛥil of ᚦe ᛥed he rides
ᚦough pᛳr be ᚦe horse he has
62
When ᚦe ᛠgle comes
to ᚦe ancient sᛠ
He snaps and haᛝs his hᛠd
So is a man
in ᚦe midᛥ of a ᚦroᛝ
Who few to spᛠk for him finds
63
To queᛥion and answer
muᛥ al be rᛠdy
Who wiᛲ to be known as wise
Tel one ᚦy ᚦoughts
but beware of two
Al know what is known to ᚦre
64
ᚦe man who is prudent
a mᛠsured use
Of ᚦe might he has wil make
He finds when amoᛝ
ᚦe brave he fares
ᚦat ᚦe boldeᛥ he may not be
65
Oft for ᚦe words
ᚦat to oᚦers one spᛠks
He wil get but an evil gift
6
Tᛳ ᛠrly to many
a metiᛝ I came
And some tᛳ late have I sought
ᚦe ber was al drunk
or not yet brewed
Litle ᚦe loaᚦed man finds
67
To ᚦeir homes men would bid
me hiᚦer and yon
If at mᛠltime I neded no mᛠt
Or would haᛝ two hams
in my true friends house
Where only one I had ᛠten
68
Fire for men
is ᚦe faireᛥ gift
And power to se ᚦe sun
Hᛠlᚦ as wel
if a man may have it
And a life not ᛥained wiᚦ sin
69
Al wretched is no man
ᚦough never so sick
Some from ᚦeir sons have joy
Some win it from kinsmen
and some from ᚦeir wᛠlᚦ
And some from worᚦy works
70
It is beter to live
ᚦan to lie a corpse
ᚦe live man catches ᚦe cow
I saw flames rise
for ᚦe rich mans pyre
And before his dᛳr he lay dᛠd
71
ᚦe lame rides a horse
ᚦe handles is herdsman
ᚦe dᛠf in batle is bold
ᚦe blind man is beter
ᚦan one ᚦat is burned
No gᛳd can come of a corpse
72
A son is beter
ᚦough late he be born
And his faᚦer to dᛠᚦ have fared
Memoryᛥones
seldom ᛥand by ᚦe road
Save when kinsman honors his kin
73
Two make a batle
ᚦe toᛝue slays ᚦe hᛠd
In ᛠch fury coat
a fiᛥ I lᛳk for
74
He welcomes ᚦe night
whose fare is enough
ᛲort are ᚦe yards of a ᛲip
Unᛠsy are autumn nights
Ful oft dᛟs ᚦe wᛠᚦer
chaᛝe in a wek
And more in a monᚦs time
75
A man knows not
if noᚦiᛝ he knows
ᚦat gold oft apes begets
One man is wᛠlᚦy
and one is pᛳr
Yet scorn for him none ᛲould know
76
Amoᛝ Fitjuᛝs sons
saw I welᛥocked folds
Now bᛠr ᚦey ᚦe begars ᛥaf
Wᛠlᚦ is as swift
as a winkiᛝ eye
Of friends ᚦe falseᛥ it is
7
Catle die
and kinsmen die
And so one dies ones self
But a noble name
wil never die
If gᛳd renown one gets
78
Catle die
and kinsmen die
And so one dies ones self
One ᚦiᛝ now
ᚦat never dies
ᚦe fame of a dᛠd mans deds
79
Certain is ᚦat
which is sought from runes
ᚦat ᚦe gods so grᛠt have made
And ᚦe MaᛥerPᛟt painted
of ᚦe race of gods
Silence is safeᛥ and beᛥ
80
An unwise man
if a maidens love
Or wᛠlᚦ he chances to win
His pride wil wax
but his wisdom never
ᛥraight forward he fares in conceit
81
Give praise to ᚦe day at eveniᛝ
to a woman on her pyre
To a wᛠpon which is tried
to a maid at wed lock
To ice when it is crosed
to ale ᚦat is drunk
82
When ᚦe gale blows hew wᛳd
in fair winds sek ᚦe water
Sport wiᚦ maidens at dusk
for days eyes are many
From ᚦe ᛲip sek swiftnes
from ᚦe ᛲield protection
Cuts from ᚦe sword
from ᚦe maiden kises
83
By ᚦe fire drink ale
over ice go on skates
Buy a ᛥed ᚦat is lᛠn
and a sword when tarniᛲed
ᚦe horse at home faten
ᚦe hound in ᚦy dweliᛝ
84
A man ᛲal truᛥ not
ᚦe oaᚦ of a maid
Nor ᚦe word a woman spᛠks
For ᚦeir hᛠrts on a whirliᛝ
whel were faᛲioned
And fickle ᚦeir brᛠᛥs were formed
85
In a brᛠkiᛝ bow
or a burniᛝ flame
A raveniᛝ wolf
or a croakiᛝ raven
In a gruntiᛝ boar
a tre wiᚦ rᛳts broken
In bilowy sᛠs
or a bubliᛝ ketle
86
In a flyiᛝ arow
or faliᛝ waters
In ice new formed
or ᚦe serpents folds
In a brides bedspech
or a broken sword
In ᚦe sport of bᛠrs
or in sons of kiᛝs
87
In a calf ᚦat is sick
or a ᛥuborn ᚦral
A flateriᛝ witch
or a fᛟ new slain
8
In a broᚦers slayer
if ᚦou met him abroad
In a halfburned house
in a horse ful swift
One leg is hurt
and ᚦe horse is useles
None had ever such faiᚦ
as to truᛥ in ᚦem al
89
Hope not tᛳ surely
for ᛠrly harveᛥ
Nor truᛥ tᛳ sᛳn in ᚦy son
ᚦe field neds gᛳd wᛠᚦer
ᚦe son neds wisdom
And oft is eiᚦer denied
90
ᚦe love of women
fickle of wil
Is like ᛥartiᛝ ᛟr ice
wiᚦ a ᛥed unᛲod
A twoyᛠrold reᛥive
and litle tamed
Or ᛥeriᛝ a ruderles
ᛲip in a ᛥorm
Or lame huntiᛝ reinder
on slipery rocks
91
Clᛠr now wil I spᛠk
for I know ᚦem boᚦ
Men false to women are found
When faireᛥ we spᛠk
ᚦen falseᛥ we ᚦink
Againᛥ wisdom we work wiᚦ deceit
92
Soft words ᛲal he spᛠk
and wᛠlᚦ ᛲal he ofer
Who loᛝs for a maidens love
And ᚦe bᛠuty praise
of ᚦe maiden bright
He wins whose wᛳiᛝ is beᛥ
93
Fault for loviᛝ
let no man find
Ever wiᚦ any oᚦer
Oft ᚦe wise are fetered
where fᛳls go fre
By bᛠuty ᚦat breds desire
94
Fault wiᚦ anoᚦer
let no man find
For what touches many a man
Wise men oft
into witles fᛳls
Are made by mighty love
95
ᚦe hᛠd alone knows
what dwels nᛠr ᚦe hᛠrt
A man knows his mind alone
No sicknes is worse
to one who is wise
ᚦan to lack ᚦe loᛝedfor joy
96
ᚦis found I myself
when I sat in ᚦe reds
And loᛝ my love awaited
As my life ᚦe maiden
wise I loved
Yet her I never had
97
Biliᛝs daughter
I found on her bed
In slumber bright as ᚦe sun
Empty apᛠred
an ᛠrls eᛥate
Wiᚦout ᚦat form so fair
98
Oᚦin again
at eveniᛝ come
If a woman ᚦou wouldᛥ win
Evil it were
if oᚦers ᚦan we
ᛲould know of such a sin
9
Away I haᛥened
hopiᛝ for joy
And careles of counsel wise
Wel I believed
ᚦat sᛳn I ᛲould win
Mᛠsureles joy wiᚦ ᚦe maid
10
So came I next
when night it was
ᚦe wariors al were awake
Wiᚦ burniᛝ lights
and waviᛝ brands
I lᛠrned my luckes way
101
At morniᛝ ᚦen
when once more I came
And al were slepiᛝ ᛥil
A dog found
in ᚦe fair ones place
Bound ᚦere upon her bed
102
Many fair maids
if a man but tries ᚦem
False to a lover are found
ᚦat did I lᛠrn
when I loᛝed to gain
Wiᚦ wiles ᚦe maiden wise
Foul scorn was my med
from ᚦe crafty maid
And nought from ᚦe woman I won
103
ᚦough glad at home
and mery wiᚦ gueᛥs
A man ᛲal be wary and wise
ᚦe sage and ᛲrewd
wide wisdom sekiᛝ
Muᛥ se ᚦat his spech be fair
A fᛳl is he named
who nought can say
For such is ᚦe way of ᚦe witles
104
I found ᚦe old giant
now back have I fared
Smal gain from silence I got
Ful many a word
my wil to get
I spoke in Sutuᛝs hal
105
ᚦe mouᚦ of Rati
made rᛳm for my pasage
And space in ᚦe ᛥone he gnawed
Above and below
ᚦe giants paᚦs lay
So raᛲly I risked my hᛠd
106
Gunloᚦ gave
on a golden ᛥᛳl
A drink of ᚦe marvelous mᛠd
A harᛲ reward
did I let her have
For her heroic hᛠrt
And her spirit troubled sore
107
ᚦe welᛠrned bᛠuty
wel I enjoyed
Litle ᚦe wise man lacks
So Oᚦrörir now
has up ben brought
To ᚦe midᛥ of ᚦe men of ᛠrᚦ
108
Hardly meᚦinks
would I home have come
And left ᚦe giants land
Had not Gunloᚦ helped me
ᚦe maiden gᛳd
Whose arms about me had ben
109
ᚦe day ᚦat folowed
ᚦe froᛥgiants came
Some word of Hor to win
And into ᚦe hal of Hor
Of Bolverk ᚦey asked
were he back midᛥ ᚦe gods
Or had Sutuᛝ slain him ᚦere
10
On his riᛝ swore Oᚦin
ᚦe oaᚦ meᚦinks
Who now his troᚦ ᛲal truᛥ
Sutuᛝs betrayal
he sought wiᚦ drink
And Gunloᚦ to grief he left
1
It is time to chant
from ᚦe chanters ᛥᛳl
By ᚦe wels of Urᚦ I was
I saw and was silent
I saw and ᚦought
And hᛠrd ᚦe spech of Hor
Of runes hᛠrd I words
nor were counsels wantiᛝ
At ᚦe hal of Hor
In ᚦe hal of Hor
Such was ᚦe spech I hᛠrd
12
I rede ᚦe Lodfafnir
and hᛠr ᚦou my rede
Profit ᚦou haᛥ if ᚦou hᛠreᛥ
Grᛠt ᚦy gain if ᚦou lᛠrneᛥ
Rise not at night

Profit ᚦou haᛥ if ᚦou hᛠreᛥ
Grᛠt ᚦy gain if ᚦou lᛠrneᛥ
Beware of slep

Such is her might

For ᚦe council or metiᛝ of men
Mᛠt ᚦou hateᛥ

And sadly to slumber ᚦou fareᛥ
