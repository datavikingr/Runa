Wiᚦin ᚦe gates
ere a man ᛲall go
Full warily let him watch
Full loᛝ let him lᛳk about him
For little he knows
where a fᛟ may lurk
And sit in ᚦe sᛠts wiᚦin
2
Hail to ᚦe giver
a gueᛥ has come
Where ᛲall ᚦe ᛥraᛝer sit
Swift ᛲall he be
who wiᚦ swords ᛲall try
ᚦe prᛳf of his might to make
3
Fire he needs
who wiᚦ frozen knees
Has come from ᚦe cold wiᚦout
Fᛳd and cloᚦes
muᛥ ᚦe farer have
ᚦe man from ᚦe mountains come
4
Water and towels
and welcomiᛝ speech
ᛲould he find who comes to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
If renown he would get
and again be greeted
Wisely and well muᛥ he act
5
Wits muᛥ he have
who wanders wide
But all is ᛠsy at home
At ᚦe witless man
ᚦe wise ᛲall wink
When amoᛝ such men he sits
6
A man ᛲall not boaᛥ
of his keenness of mind
But keep it close in his brᛠᛥ
To ᚦe silent and wise
dᛟs ill come seldom
When he gᛟs as gueᛥ to a house
For a faᛥer friend
one never finds
ᚦan wisdom tried and true
7
ᚦe knowiᛝ gueᛥ
who gᛟs to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
In silent attention sits
Wiᚦ his ᛠrs he hᛠrs
wiᚦ his eyes he watches
ᚦus wary are wise men all
8
Happy ᚦe one
who wins for himself
Favor and praises fair
Less safe by far
is ᚦe wisdom found
ᚦat is hid in anoᚦers hᛠrt
9
Happy ᚦe man
who has while he lives
Wisdom and praise as well
For evil counsel
a man full oft
Has from anoᚦers hᛠrt
10
A better burden
may no man bᛠr
For wanderiᛝs wide ᚦan wisdom
It is better ᚦan wᛠlᚦ
on unknown ways
And in grief a refuge it gives
11
A better burden
may no man bᛠr
For wanderiᛝs wide ᚦan wisdom
Worse fᛳd for ᚦe journey
he briᛝs not afield
ᚦan an overdrinkiᛝ of ale
12
Less gᛳd ᚦere lies
ᚦan moᛥ believe
In ale for mortal men
For ᚦe more he drinks
ᚦe less dᛟs man
Of his mind ᚦe maᛥery hold
13
Over beer ᚦe bird
of forgetfulness brᛳds
And ᛥᛠls ᚦe minds of men
Wiᚦ ᚦe herons fᛠᚦers
fettered I lay
And in Gunnloᚦs house was held
14
Drunk I was
I was dᛠddrunk
When wiᚦ Fjalar wise I was
Tis ᚦe beᛥ of drinkiᛝ
if back one briᛝs
His wisdom wiᚦ him home
15
ᚦe son of a kiᛝ
ᛲall be silent and wise
And bold in battle as well
Bravely and gladly
a man ᛲall go
Till ᚦe day of his dᛠᚦ is come
16
ᚦe sluggard believes
he ᛲall live forever
If ᚦe fight he faces not
But age ᛲall not grant him
ᚦe gift of pᛠce
ᚦough spᛠrs may spare his life
17
ᚦe fᛳl is agape
when he comes to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
He ᛥammers or else is ᛥill
But sᛳn if he gets
a drink is it seen
What ᚦe mind of ᚦe man is like
18
He alone is aware
who has wandered wide
And far abroad has fared
How grᛠt a mind
is guided by him
ᚦat wᛠlᚦ of wisdom has
19
ᛲun not ᚦe mᛠd
but drink in mᛠsure
Spᛠk to ᚦe point or be ᛥill
For rudeness none
ᛲall rightly blame ᚦee
If sᛳn ᚦy bed ᚦou seekeᛥ
20
ᚦe greedy man
if his mind be vague
Will ᛠt till sick he is
ᚦe vulgar man
when amoᛝ ᚦe wise
To scorn by his belly is brought
21
ᚦe herds know well
when home ᚦey ᛲall fare
And ᚦen from ᚦe grass ᚦey go
But ᚦe fᛳliᛲ man
his bellys mᛠsure
ᛲall never know aright
22
A paltry man
and pᛳr of mind
At all ᚦiᛝs ever mocks
For never he knows
what he ought to know
ᚦat he is not free from faults
23
ᚦe witless man
is awake all night
ᚦinkiᛝ of many ᚦiᛝs
Careworn he is
when ᚦe morniᛝ comes
And his wᛟ is juᛥ as it was
24
ᚦe fᛳliᛲ man
for friends all ᚦose
Who laugh at him will hold
When amoᛝ ᚦe wise
he marks it not
ᚦough hatred of him ᚦey spᛠk
25
ᚦe fᛳliᛲ man
for friends all ᚦose
Who laugh at him will hold
But ᚦe truᚦ when he comes
to ᚦe council he lᛠrns
ᚦat few in his favor will spᛠk
26
An ignorant man
ᚦinks ᚦat all he knows
When he sits by himself in a corner
But never what answer
to make he knows
When oᚦers wiᚦ queᛥions come
27
A witless man
when he meets wiᚦ men
Had beᛥ in silence abide
For no one ᛲall find
ᚦat noᚦiᛝ he knows
If his mouᚦ is not open tᛳ much
But a man knows not
if noᚦiᛝ he knows
When his mouᚦ has been open tᛳ much
28
Wise ᛲall he seem
who well can queᛥion
And also answer well
Nought is concᛠled
ᚦat men may say
Amoᛝ ᚦe sons of men
29
Often he spᛠks
who never is ᛥill
Wiᚦ words ᚦat win no faiᚦ
ᚦe babbliᛝ toᛝue
if a bridle it find not
Oft for itself siᛝs ill
30
In mockery no one
a man ᛲall hold
Alᚦough he fare to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
Wise seems one oft
if nought he is asked
And safely he sits dryskinned
31
Wise a gueᛥ holds it
to take to his heels
When mock of anoᚦer he makes
But little he knows
who laughs at ᚦe fᛠᛥ
ᚦough he mocks in ᚦe midᛥ of his fᛟs
32
Friendly of mind
are many men
Till fᛠᛥiᛝ ᚦey mock at ᚦeir friends
To mankind a bane
muᛥ it ever be
When gueᛥs togeᚦer ᛥrive
33
Oft ᛲould one make
an ᛠrly mᛠl
Nor faᛥiᛝ come to ᚦe fᛠᛥ
Else he sits and chews
as if he would choke
And little is able to ask
34
Crᛳked and far
is ᚦe road to a fᛟ
ᚦough his house on ᚦe highway be
But wide and ᛥraight
is ᚦe way to a friend
ᚦough far away he fare
35
Forᚦ ᛲall one go
nor ᛥay as a gueᛥ
In a siᛝle spot forever
Love becomes loaᚦiᛝ
if loᛝ one sits
By ᚦe hᛠrᚦ in anoᚦers home
36
Better a house
ᚦough a hut it be
A man is maᛥer at home
A pair of goats
and a patchedup rᛳf
Are better far ᚦan beggiᛝ
37
Better a house
ᚦough a hut it be
A man is maᛥer at home
His hᛠrt is bleediᛝ
who needs muᛥ beg
When fᛳd he fain would have
38
Away from his arms
in ᚦe open field
A man ᛲould fare not a fᛳt
For never he knows
when ᚦe need for a spᛠr
ᛲall arise on ᚦe diᛥant road
39
If wᛠlᚦ a man
has won for himself
Let him never suffer in need
Oft he saves for a fᛟ
what he plans for a friend
For much gᛟs worse ᚦan we wiᛲ
40
None so free wiᚦ gifts
or fᛳd have I found
ᚦat gladly he tᛳk not a gift
Nor one who so widely
scattered his wᛠlᚦ
ᚦat of recompense hatred he had
41
Friends ᛲall gladden ᛠch oᚦer
wiᚦ arms and garments
As ᛠch for himself can see
Giftgivers friendᛲips
are loᛝeᛥ found
If fair ᚦeir fates may be
42
To his friend a man
a friend ᛲall prove
And gifts wiᚦ gifts requite
But men ᛲall mockiᛝ
wiᚦ mockery answer
And fraud wiᚦ falsehᛳd meet
43
To his friend a man
a friend ᛲall prove
To him and ᚦe friend of his friend
But never a man
ᛲall friendᛲip make
Wiᚦ one of his fᛟmans friends
44
If a friend ᚦou haᛥ
whom ᚦou fully wilt truᛥ
And gᛳd from him wouldᛥ get
ᚦy ᚦoughts wiᚦ his miᛝle
and gifts ᛲalt ᚦou make
And fare to find him oft
45
If anoᚦer ᚦou haᛥ
whom ᚦou hardly wilt truᛥ
Yet gᛳd from him wouldᛥ get
ᚦou ᛲalt spᛠk him fair
but falsely ᚦink
And fraud wiᚦ falsehᛳd requite
46
So is it wiᚦ him
whom ᚦou hardly wilt truᛥ
And whose mind ᚦou mayᛥ not know
Laugh wiᚦ him mayᛥ ᚦou
but spᛠk not ᚦy mind
Like gifts to his ᛲalt ᚦou give
47
Youᛝ was I once
and wandered alone
And nought of ᚦe road I knew
Rich did I feel
when a comrade I found
For man is mans delight
48
ᚦe lives of ᚦe brave
and noble are beᛥ
Sorrows ᚦey seldom feed
But ᚦe coward fᛠr
of all ᚦiᛝs feels
And not gladly ᚦe niggard gives
49
My garments once
in a field I gave
To a pair of carven poles
Herᛟs ᚦey seemed
when cloᚦes ᚦey had
But ᚦe naked man is nought
50
On ᚦe hillside drᛠr
ᚦe firtree dies
All bᛳtless its needles and bark
It is like a man
whom no one loves
Why ᛲould his life be loᛝ
51
Hotter ᚦan fire
between false friends
Dᛟs friendᛲip five days burn
When ᚦe sixᚦ day comes
ᚦe fire cᛳls
And ended is all ᚦe love
52
No grᛠt ᚦiᛝ needs
a man to give
Oft little will purchase praise
Wiᚦ half a loaf
and a halffilled cup
A friend full faᛥ I made
53
A little sand
has a little sᛠ
And small are ᚦe minds of men
ᚦough all men are not
equal in wisdom
Yet halfwise only are all
54
A mᛠsure of wisdom
ᛠch man ᛲall have
But never tᛳ much let him know
ᚦe faireᛥ lives
do ᚦose men live
Whose wisdom wide has grown
55
A mᛠsure of wisdom
ᛠch man ᛲall have
But never tᛳ much let him know
For ᚦe wise mans hᛠrt
is seldom happy
If wisdom tᛳ grᛠt he has won
56
A mᛠsure of wisdom
ᛠch man ᛲall have
But never tᛳ much let him know
Let no man ᚦe fate
before him see
For so is he freeᛥ from sorrow
57
A brand from a brand
is kindled and burned
And fire from fire begotten
And man by his speech
is known to men
And ᚦe ᛥupid by ᚦeir ᛥillness
58
He muᛥ ᛠrly go forᚦ
who fain ᚦe blᛳd
Or ᚦe gᛳds of anoᚦer would get
ᚦe wolf ᚦat lies idle
ᛲall win little mᛠt
Or ᚦe sleepiᛝ man success
59
He muᛥ ᛠrly go forᚦ
whose workers are few
Himself his work to seek
Much remains undone
for ᚦe morniᛝsleeper
For ᚦe swift is wᛠlᚦ half won
60
Of sᛠsoned ᛲiᛝles
and ᛥrips of bark
For ᚦe ᚦatch let one know his need
And how much of wᛳd
he muᛥ have for a monᚦ
Or in half a yᛠr he will use
61
Waᛲed and fed
to ᚦe council fare
But care not tᛳ much for ᚦy cloᚦes
Let none be aᛲamed
of his ᛲᛟs and hose
Less ᛥill of ᚦe ᛥeed he rides
ᚦough pᛳr be ᚦe horse he has
62
When ᚦe ᛠgle comes
to ᚦe ancient sᛠ
He snaps and haᛝs his hᛠd
So is a man
in ᚦe midᛥ of a ᚦroᛝ
Who few to spᛠk for him finds
63
To queᛥion and answer
muᛥ all be rᛠdy
Who wiᛲ to be known as wise
Tell one ᚦy ᚦoughts
but beware of two
All know what is known to ᚦree
64
ᚦe man who is prudent
a mᛠsured use
Of ᚦe might he has will make
He finds when amoᛝ
ᚦe brave he fares
ᚦat ᚦe boldeᛥ he may not be
65
Oft for ᚦe words
ᚦat to oᚦers one spᛠks
He will get but an evil gift
66
Tᛳ ᛠrly to many
a meetiᛝ I came
And some tᛳ late have I sought
ᚦe beer was all drunk
or not yet brewed
Little ᚦe loaᚦed man finds
67
To ᚦeir homes men would bid
me hiᚦer and yon
If at mᛠltime I needed no mᛠt
Or would haᛝ two hams
in my true friends house
Where only one I had ᛠten
68
Fire for men
is ᚦe faireᛥ gift
And power to see ᚦe sun
Hᛠlᚦ as well
if a man may have it
And a life not ᛥained wiᚦ sin
69
All wretched is no man
ᚦough never so sick
Some from ᚦeir sons have joy
Some win it from kinsmen
and some from ᚦeir wᛠlᚦ
And some from worᚦy works
70
It is better to live
ᚦan to lie a corpse
ᚦe live man catches ᚦe cow
I saw flames rise
for ᚦe rich mans pyre
And before his dᛳr he lay dᛠd
71
ᚦe lame rides a horse
ᚦe handless is herdsman
ᚦe dᛠf in battle is bold
ᚦe blind man is better
ᚦan one ᚦat is burned
No gᛳd can come of a corpse
72
A son is better
ᚦough late he be born
And his faᚦer to dᛠᚦ have fared
Memoryᛥones
seldom ᛥand by ᚦe road
Save when kinsman honors his kin
73
Two make a battle
ᚦe toᛝue slays ᚦe hᛠd
In ᛠch furry coat
a fiᛥ I lᛳk for
74
He welcomes ᚦe night
whose fare is enough
ᛲort are ᚦe yards of a ᛲip
Unᛠsy are autumn nights
Full oft dᛟs ᚦe wᛠᚦer
chaᛝe in a week
And more in a monᚦs time
75
A man knows not
if noᚦiᛝ he knows
ᚦat gold oft apes begets
One man is wᛠlᚦy
and one is pᛳr
Yet scorn for him none ᛲould know
76
Amoᛝ Fitjuᛝs sons
saw I wellᛥocked folds
Now bᛠr ᚦey ᚦe beggars ᛥaff
Wᛠlᚦ is as swift
as a winkiᛝ eye
Of friends ᚦe falseᛥ it is
77
Cattle die
and kinsmen die
And so one dies ones self
But a noble name
will never die
If gᛳd renown one gets
78
Cattle die
and kinsmen die
And so one dies ones self
One ᚦiᛝ now
ᚦat never dies
ᚦe fame of a dᛠd mans deeds
79
Certain is ᚦat
which is sought from runes
ᚦat ᚦe gods so grᛠt have made
And ᚦe MaᛥerPᛟt painted
of ᚦe race of gods
Silence is safeᛥ and beᛥ
80
An unwise man
if a maidens love
Or wᛠlᚦ he chances to win
His pride will wax
but his wisdom never
ᛥraight forward he fares in conceit
81
Give praise to ᚦe day at eveniᛝ
to a woman on her pyre
To a wᛠpon which is tried
to a maid at wed lock
To ice when it is crossed
to ale ᚦat is drunk
82
When ᚦe gale blows hew wᛳd
in fair winds seek ᚦe water
Sport wiᚦ maidens at dusk
for days eyes are many
From ᚦe ᛲip seek swiftness
from ᚦe ᛲield protection
Cuts from ᚦe sword
from ᚦe maiden kisses
83
By ᚦe fire drink ale
over ice go on skates
Buy a ᛥeed ᚦat is lᛠn
and a sword when tarniᛲed
ᚦe horse at home fatten
ᚦe hound in ᚦy dwelliᛝ
84
A man ᛲall truᛥ not
ᚦe oaᚦ of a maid
Nor ᚦe word a woman spᛠks
For ᚦeir hᛠrts on a whirliᛝ
wheel were faᛲioned
And fickle ᚦeir brᛠᛥs were formed
85
In a brᛠkiᛝ bow
or a burniᛝ flame
A raveniᛝ wolf
or a croakiᛝ raven
In a gruntiᛝ boar
a tree wiᚦ rᛳts broken
In billowy sᛠs
or a bubbliᛝ kettle
86
In a flyiᛝ arrow
or falliᛝ waters
In ice new formed
or ᚦe serpents folds
In a brides bedspeech
or a broken sword
In ᚦe sport of bᛠrs
or in sons of kiᛝs
87
In a calf ᚦat is sick
or a ᛥubborn ᚦrall
A flatteriᛝ witch
or a fᛟ new slain
88
In a broᚦers slayer
if ᚦou meet him abroad
In a halfburned house
in a horse full swift
One leg is hurt
and ᚦe horse is useless
None had ever such faiᚦ
as to truᛥ in ᚦem all
89
Hope not tᛳ surely
for ᛠrly harveᛥ
Nor truᛥ tᛳ sᛳn in ᚦy son
ᚦe field needs gᛳd wᛠᚦer
ᚦe son needs wisdom
And oft is eiᚦer denied
90
ᚦe love of women
fickle of will
Is like ᛥartiᛝ ᛟr ice
wiᚦ a ᛥeed unᛲod
A twoyᛠrold reᛥive
and little tamed
Or ᛥeeriᛝ a rudderless
ᛲip in a ᛥorm
Or lame huntiᛝ reindeer
on slippery rocks
91
Clᛠr now will I spᛠk
for I know ᚦem boᚦ
Men false to women are found
When faireᛥ we spᛠk
ᚦen falseᛥ we ᚦink
Againᛥ wisdom we work wiᚦ deceit
92
Soft words ᛲall he spᛠk
and wᛠlᚦ ᛲall he offer
Who loᛝs for a maidens love
And ᚦe bᛠuty praise
of ᚦe maiden bright
He wins whose wᛳiᛝ is beᛥ
93
Fault for loviᛝ
let no man find
Ever wiᚦ any oᚦer
Oft ᚦe wise are fettered
where fᛳls go free
By bᛠuty ᚦat breeds desire
94
Fault wiᚦ anoᚦer
let no man find
For what touches many a man
Wise men oft
into witless fᛳls
Are made by mighty love
95
ᚦe hᛠd alone knows
what dwells nᛠr ᚦe hᛠrt
A man knows his mind alone
No sickness is worse
to one who is wise
ᚦan to lack ᚦe loᛝedfor joy
96
ᚦis found I myself
when I sat in ᚦe reeds
And loᛝ my love awaited
As my life ᚦe maiden
wise I loved
Yet her I never had
97
Billiᛝs daughter
I found on her bed
In slumber bright as ᚦe sun
Empty appᛠred
an ᛠrls eᛥate
Wiᚦout ᚦat form so fair
98
Oᚦin again
at eveniᛝ come
If a woman ᚦou wouldᛥ win
Evil it were
if oᚦers ᚦan we
ᛲould know of such a sin
99
Away I haᛥened
hopiᛝ for joy
And careless of counsel wise
Well I believed
ᚦat sᛳn I ᛲould win
Mᛠsureless joy wiᚦ ᚦe maid
100
So came I next
when night it was
ᚦe warriors all were awake
Wiᚦ burniᛝ lights
and waviᛝ brands
I lᛠrned my luckess way
101
At morniᛝ ᚦen
when once more I came
And all were sleepiᛝ ᛥill
A dog found
in ᚦe fair ones place
Bound ᚦere upon her bed
102
Many fair maids
if a man but tries ᚦem
False to a lover are found
ᚦat did I lᛠrn
when I loᛝed to gain
Wiᚦ wiles ᚦe maiden wise
Foul scorn was my meed
from ᚦe crafty maid
And nought from ᚦe woman I won
103
ᚦough glad at home
and merry wiᚦ gueᛥs
A man ᛲall be wary and wise
ᚦe sage and ᛲrewd
wide wisdom seekiᛝ
Muᛥ see ᚦat his speech be fair
A fᛳl is he named
who nought can say
For such is ᚦe way of ᚦe witless
104
I found ᚦe old giant
now back have I fared
Small gain from silence I got
Full many a word
my will to get
I spoke in Suttuᛝs hall
105
ᚦe mouᚦ of Rati
made rᛳm for my passage
And space in ᚦe ᛥone he gnawed
Above and below
ᚦe giants paᚦs lay
So raᛲly I risked my hᛠd
106
Gunnloᚦ gave
on a golden ᛥᛳl
A drink of ᚦe marvelous mᛠd
A harᛲ reward
did I let her have
For her heroic hᛠrt
And her spirit troubled sore
107
ᚦe wellᛠrned bᛠuty
well I enjoyed
Little ᚦe wise man lacks
So Oᚦrörir now
has up been brought
To ᚦe midᛥ of ᚦe men of ᛠrᚦ
108
Hardly meᚦinks
would I home have come
And left ᚦe giants land
Had not Gunnloᚦ helped me
ᚦe maiden gᛳd
Whose arms about me had been
109
ᚦe day ᚦat followed
ᚦe froᛥgiants came
Some word of Hor to win
And into ᚦe hall of Hor
Of Bolverk ᚦey asked
were he back midᛥ ᚦe gods
Or had Suttuᛝ slain him ᚦere
110
On his riᛝ swore Oᚦin
ᚦe oaᚦ meᚦinks
Who now his troᚦ ᛲall truᛥ
Suttuᛝs betrayal
he sought wiᚦ drink
And Gunnloᚦ to grief he left
111
It is time to chant
from ᚦe chanters ᛥᛳl
By ᚦe wells of Urᚦ I was
I saw and was silent
I saw and ᚦought
And hᛠrd ᚦe speech of Hor
Of runes hᛠrd I words
nor were counsels wantiᛝ
At ᚦe hall of Hor
In ᚦe hall of Hor
Such was ᚦe speech I hᛠrd
112
I rede ᚦee Loddfafnir
and hᛠr ᚦou my rede
Profit ᚦou haᛥ if ᚦou hᛠreᛥ
Grᛠt ᚦy gain if ᚦou lᛠrneᛥ
Rise not at night
save if news ᚦou seekeᛥ
Or fain to ᚦe ouᚦouse wouldᛥ fare
113
I rede ᚦee Loddfafnir
and hᛠr ᚦou my rede
Profit ᚦou haᛥ if ᚦou hᛠreᛥ
Grᛠt ᚦy gain if ᚦou lᛠrneᛥ
Beware of sleep
on a witchs bosom
Nor let her limbs ensnare ᚦee
114
Such is her might
ᚦat ᚦou haᛥ no mind
For ᚦe council or meetiᛝ of men
Mᛠt ᚦou hateᛥ
joy ᚦou haᛥ not
And sadly to slumber ᚦou fareᛥ
115
I rede ᚦee Loddfafnir
and hᛠr ᚦou my rede
Profit ᚦou haᛥ if ᚦou hᛠreᛥ
Grᛠt ᚦy gain if ᚦou lᛠrneᛥ
Seek never to win
ᚦe wife of anoᚦer
Or loᛝ for her secret love
