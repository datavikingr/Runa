Kiᛝ Hrauᚦuᛝ had two sons one was called Agnar and ᚦe oᚦer Geirröᚦ
Agnar was ten winters old and Geirröᚦ eight
Once ᚦey boᚦ rowed in a boat wiᚦ ᚦeir fiᛲiᛝgᛠr to catch little fiᛲ
and ᚦe wind drove ᚦem out into ᚦe sᛠ
In ᚦe darkness of ᚦe night ᚦey were wrecked on ᚦe ᛲore and goiᛝ up ᚦey found a pᛳr pᛠsant wiᚦ whom ᚦey ᛥayed ᚦrough ᚦe winter
ᚦe housewife tᛳk care of Agnar and ᚦe pᛠsant cared for Geirröᚦ and taught him wisdom
In ᚦe spriᛝ ᚦe pᛠsant gave him a boat and when ᚦe couple led ᚦem to ᚦe ᛲore ᚦe pᛠsant spoke secretly wiᚦ Geirröᚦ
ᚦey had a fair wind and came to ᚦeir faᚦers landiᛝplace
Geirröᚦ was forward in ᚦe boat
he lᛠped up on land but puᛲed out ᚦe boat and said Go ᚦou now where evil may have ᚦee
ᚦe boat drifted out to sᛠ Geirröᚦ however went up to ᚦe house
and was well received but his faᚦer was dᛠd
ᚦen Geirröᚦ was made kiᛝ and became a renowned man
Oᚦin and Frigg sat in Hliᚦskjolf and lᛳked over all ᚦe worlds
Oᚦin said Seeᛥ ᚦou Agnar ᚦy foᛥerliᛝ how he begets children wiᚦ a giantess in ᚦe cave
But Geirröᚦ my foᛥerliᛝ is a kiᛝ and now rules over his land
Frigg said He is so miserly ᚦat he tortures his gueᛥs if he ᚦinks ᚦat tᛳ many of ᚦem come to him
