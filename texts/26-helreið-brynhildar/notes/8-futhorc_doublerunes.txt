After ᚦe dᛠᚦ of Brynhild ᚦere were made two balefires
ᚦe one for Sigurᚦ and ᚦat burned firᛥ
and on ᚦe oᚦer was Brynhild burned
and ᛲe was on a wagon which was covered
wiᚦ a rich cloᚦ
ᚦus it is told
ᚦat Brynhild went in ᚦe wagon on Helway
and passed by a house where dwelt a certain giantess
ᚦe giantess spake
1
ᚦou ᛲalt not furᚦer
forward fare
My dwelliᛝ ribbed
wiᚦ rocks across
More seemly it were
at ᚦy wᛠviᛝ to ᛥay
ᚦan anoᚦers husband
here to follow
2
What wouldᛥ ᚦou have
from Valland here
Fickle of hᛠrt
in ᚦis my house
Goldgoddess now
if ᚦou wouldᛥ know
Herᛟs blᛳd
from ᚦy hands haᛥ waᛲed
Brynhild spake
3
Chide me not woman
from rocky walls
ᚦough to battle once
I was wont to go
Better ᚦan ᚦou
I ᛲall seem to be
When men us two
ᛲall truly know
ᚦe giantess spake
4
ᚦou waᛥ Brynhild
Buᚦlis daughter
For ᚦe worᛥ of evils
born in ᚦe world
To dᛠᚦ ᚦou haᛥ given
Gjukis children
And laid ᚦeir lofty
house full low
Brynhild spake
5
Truᚦ from ᚦe wagon here I tell ᚦee
Witless one
if know ᚦou wilt
How ᚦe heirs of Gjuki
gave me to be
Joyless ever
a brᛠker of oaᚦs
6
Hild ᚦe helmed
in Hlymdalir
ᚦey named me of old
all ᚦey who knew me
7
ᚦe monarch bold
ᚦe swanrobes bore
Of ᚦe siᛥers eight
benᛠᚦ an oak
Twelve winters I was
if know ᚦou wilt
When oaᚦs I yielded
ᚦe kiᛝ so youᛝ
8
Next I let
ᚦe lᛠder of Goᚦs
Hjalmgunnar ᚦe old
go down to hell
And victory brought
to Auᚦas broᚦer
For ᚦis was Oᚦins
aᛝer mighty
9
He beset me wiᚦ ᛲields
in Skatalund
Red and white
ᚦeir rims ᛟrlapped
He bade ᚦat my sleep
ᛲould broken be
By him who fᛠr
had nowhere found
10
He let round my hall
ᚦat souᚦward lᛳked
ᚦe branches fᛟ
highlᛠpiᛝ burn
Across it he bade
ᚦe hero come
Who brought me ᚦe gold
ᚦat Fafnir guarded
11
On Grani rode
ᚦe giver of gold
Where my foᛥerfaᚦer
ruled his folk
Beᛥ of all
he seemed to be
ᚦe prince of ᚦe Danes
when ᚦe people met
12
Happy we slept
one bed we had
As he my broᚦer
born had been
Eight were ᚦe nights
when neiᚦer ᚦere
Loviᛝ hand
on ᚦe oᚦer laid
13
Yet Guᚦrun reproached me
Gjukis daughter
ᚦat I in Sigurᚦs
arms had slept
ᚦen did I hᛠr
what I would were hid
ᚦat ᚦey had betrayed me
in takiᛝ a mate
14
Ever wiᚦ grief
and all tᛳ loᛝ
Are men and women
born in ᚦe world
But yet we ᛲall live
our lives togeᚦer
Sigurᚦ and I
Sink down Giantess
