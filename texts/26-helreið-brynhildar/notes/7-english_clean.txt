After the death of Brynhild there were made two balefires
the one for Sigurth and that burned first
and on the other was Brynhild burned
and she was on a wagon which was covered
with a rich cloth
Thus it is told
that Brynhild went in the wagon on Helway
and passed by a house where dwelt a certain giantess
The giantess spake
1
Thou shalt not further
forward fare
My dwelling ribbed
with rocks across
More seemly it were
at thy weaving to stay
Than anothers husband
here to follow
2
What wouldst thou have
from Valland here
Fickle of heart
in this my house
Goldgoddess now
if thou wouldst know
Heroes blood
from thy hands hast washed
Brynhild spake
3
Chide me not woman
from rocky walls
Though to battle once
I was wont to go
Better than thou
I shall seem to be
When men us two
shall truly know
The giantess spake
4
Thou wast Brynhild
Buthlis daughter
For the worst of evils
born in the world
To death thou hast given
Gjukis children
And laid their lofty
house full low
Brynhild spake
5
Truth from the wagon here I tell thee
Witless one
if know thou wilt
How the heirs of Gjuki
gave me to be
Joyless ever
a breaker of oaths
6
Hild the helmed
in Hlymdalir
They named me of old
all they who knew me
7
The monarch bold
the swanrobes bore
Of the sisters eight
beneath an oak
Twelve winters I was
if know thou wilt
When oaths I yielded
the king so young
8
Next I let
the leader of Goths
Hjalmgunnar the old
go down to hell
And victory brought
to Authas brother
For this was Othins
anger mighty
9
He beset me with shields
in Skatalund
Red and white
their rims oerlapped
He bade that my sleep
should broken be
By him who fear
had nowhere found
10
He let round my hall
that southward looked
The branches foe
highleaping burn
Across it he bade
the hero come
Who brought me the gold
that Fafnir guarded
11
On Grani rode
the giver of gold
Where my fosterfather
ruled his folk
Best of all
he seemed to be
The prince of the Danes
when the people met
12
Happy we slept
one bed we had
As he my brother
born had been
Eight were the nights
when neither there
Loving hand
on the other laid
13
Yet Guthrun reproached me
Gjukis daughter
That I in Sigurths
arms had slept
Then did I hear
what I would were hid
That they had betrayed me
in taking a mate
14
Ever with grief
and all too long
Are men and women
born in the world
But yet we shall live
our lives together
Sigurth and I
Sink down Giantess
