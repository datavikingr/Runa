After the death of Brynhild there were made two bale-fires, 
the one for Sigurth, and that burned first, 
and on the other was Brynhild burned, 
and she was on a wagon which was covered 
with a rich cloth. 
Thus it is told, 
that Brynhild went in the wagon on Hel-way, 
and passed by a house where dwelt a certain giantess. 
The giantess spake: 
1.
"Thou shalt not further |
forward fare,
My dwelling ribbed |
with rocks across;
More seemly it were |
at thy weaving to stay,
Than another's husband |
here to follow. 
2.
"What wouldst thou have |
from Valland here,
Fickle of heart, |
in this my house?
Gold-goddess, now, |
if thou wouldst know,
Heroes' blood |
from thy hands hast washed." 
Brynhild spake:
3.
"Chide me not, woman |
from rocky walls,
Though to battle once |
I was wont to go;
Better than thou |
I shall seem to be,
When men us two |
shall truly know." 
The giantess spake:
4.
"Thou wast, Brynhild, |
Buthli's daughter,
For the worst of evils |
born in the world;
To death thou hast given |
Gjuki's children,
And laid their lofty |
house full low." 
Brynhild spake:
5.
"Truth from the wagon here I tell thee,
Witless one, |
if know thou wilt
How the heirs of Gjuki |
gave me to be
Joyless ever, |
a breaker of oaths. 
6.
"Hild the helmed |
in Hlymdalir
They named me of old, |
all they who knew me.
7.
"The monarch bold |
the swan-robes bore
Of the sisters eight |
beneath an oak;
Twelve winters I was, |
if know thou wilt,
When oaths I yielded |
the king so young. 
8.
"Next I let |
the leader of Goths,
Hjalmgunnar the old, |
go down to hell,
And victory brought |
to Autha's brother;
For this was Othin's |
anger mighty. 
9.
"He beset me with shields |
in Skatalund,
Red and white, |
their rims o'erlapped;
He bade that my sleep |
should broken be
By him who fear |
had nowhere found. 
10.
"He let round my hall, |
that southward looked,
The branches' foe |
high-leaping burn;
Across it he bade |
the hero come
Who brought me the gold |
that Fafnir guarded 
11.
"On Grani rode |
the giver of gold,
Where my foster-father |
ruled his folk;
Best of all |
he seemed to be,
The prince of the Danes, |
when the people met. 
12.
"Happy we slept, |
one bed we had,
As he my brother |
born had been;
Eight were the nights |
when neither there
Loving hand |
on the other laid. 
13.
"Yet Guthrun reproached me, |
Gjuki's daughter,
That I in Sigurth's |
arms had slept;
Then did I hear |
what I would were hid,
That they had betrayed me |
in taking a mate. 
14.
"Ever with grief |
and all too long
Are men and women |
born in the world;
But yet we shall live |
our lives together,
Sigurth and I. |
Sink down, Giantess!"
