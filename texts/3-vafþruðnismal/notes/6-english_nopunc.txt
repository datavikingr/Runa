Othin spake
1
Counsel me Frigg 
for I long to fare
And Vafthruthnir fain would find
In wisdom old 
with the giant wise
Myself would I seek to match 
Frigg spake
2
Heerfather here 
at home would I keep
Where the gods together dwell
Amid all the giants 
an equal in might
To Vafthruthnir know I none 
Othin spake
3
Much have I fared 
much have I found
Much have I got from the gods
And fain would I know 
how Vafthruthnir now
Lives in his lofty hall 
Frigg spake
4
Safe mayst thou go 
safe come again
And safe be the way thou wendest
Father of men 
let thy mind be keen
When speech with the giant thou seekest 
5
The wisdom then 
of the giant wise
Forth did he fare to try
He found the hall 
of the father of Im
And in forthwith went Ygg 
Othin spake
6
Vafthruthnir hail 
to thy hall am I come
For thyself I fain would see
And first would I ask 
if wise thou art
Or giant all wisdom hast won 
Vafthruthnir spake
7
Who is the man 
that speaks to me
Here in my lofty hall
Forth from our dwelling 
thou never shalt fare
Unless wiser than I thou art 
Othin spake
8
Gagnrath they call me 
and thirsty I come
From a journey hard to thy hall
Welcome I look for 
for long have I fared
And gentle greeting giant 
Vafthruthnir spake
9
Why standest thou there 
on the floor whilst thou speakest
A seat shalt thou have in my hall
Then soon shall we know 
whose knowledge is more
The guests or the sages gray 
Othin spake
10
If a poor man reaches 
the home of the rich
Let him wisely speak or be still
For to him who speaks 
with the hard of heart
Will chattering ever work ill 
Vafthruthnir spake
11
Speak forth now Gagnrath 
if there from the floor
Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known
What name has the steed 
that each morn anew
The day for mankind doth draw 
Othin spake
12
Skinfaxi is he 
the steed who for men
The glittering day doth draw
The best of horses 
to heroes he seems
And brightly his mane doth burn 
Vafthruthnir spake
13
Speak forth now Gagnrath 
if there from the floor
Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known
What name has the steed 
that from East anew
Brings night for the noble gods 
Othin spake
14
Hrimfaxi name they 
the steed that anew
Brings night for the noble gods
Each morning foam 
from his bit there falls
And thence come the dews in the dales 
Vafthruthnir spake
15
Speak forth now Gagnrath 
if there from the floor
Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known
What name has the river 
that twixt the realms
Of the gods and the giants goes 
Othin spoke
16
Ifing is the river 
that twixt the realms
Of the gods and the giants goes
For all time ever 
open it flows
No ice on the river there is 
Vafthruthnir spake
17
Speak forth now Gagnrath 
if there from the floor
Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known
What name has the field 
where in fight shall meet
Surt and the gracious gods 
Othin spake
18
Vigrith is the field 
where in fight shall meet
Surt and the gracious gods
A hundred miles 
each way does it measure
And so are its boundaries set 
Vafthruthnir spake
19
Wise art thou guest 
To my bench shalt thou go
In our seats let us speak together
Here in the hall 
our heads O guest
Shall we wager our wisdom upon 
Othin spake
20
First answer me well 
if thy wisdom avails
And thou knowest it Vafthruthnir now
In earliest time 
whence came the earth
Or the sky thou giant sage 
Vafthruthnir spake
21
Out of Ymirs flesh 
was fashioned the earth
And the mountains were made of his bones
The sky from the frostcold 
giants skull
And the ocean out of his blood 
Othin spake
22
Next answer me well 
if thy wisdom avails
And thou knowest it Vafthruthnir now
Whence came the moon 
oer the world of men
That fares and the flaming sun

who begat the moon
And fathered the flaming sun
The round of heaven 
each day they run
To tell the time for men 
Othin spake
24
Third answer me well

If thou knowest it Vafthruthnir now
Whence came the day 
oer mankind that fares
Or night with the narrowing moon 
Vafthruthnir spake

is Delling called
And the night was begotten by Nor
Full moon and old 
by the gods were fashioned
To tell the time for men 
Othin spake
26
Fourth answer me well

If thou knowest it Vafthruthnir now

And Svosuth summer begat

was fashioned of old
And the eldest of Ymirs kin

ere earth was made
Was the birth of Bergelmir
Thruthgelmirs son 
was the giant strong
And Aurgelmirs grandson of old 
Othin spake
30
Sixth answer me well 
if wise thou art called
If thou knowest it Vafthruthnir now
Whence did Aurgelmir come 
with the giants kin
Long since thou giant sage 
Vafthruthnir spake

did venom drop
And waxed till a giant it was
And thence arose 
our giants race
And thus so fierce are we found 
Othin spake

If thou knowest it Vafthruthnir now
How begat he children 
the giant grim
Who never a giantess knew 
Vafthruthnir spake

of the giant of ice
Grew manchild and maid together
And foot with foot 
did the wise one fashion
A son that six heads bore 
Othin spake

What farthest back 
dost thou bear in mind
For wide is thy wisdom giant

ere earth was made
Was the birth of Bergelmir

when the giant wise
In a boat of old was borne 
Othin spake

Ninth answer me well 
if wise thou art called
If thou knowest it Vafthruthnir now
Whence comes the wind 
that fares oer the waves
Yet never itself is seen 
Vafthruthnir spake

at the end of heaven
Hr√¶svelg sits they say
And from his wings 
does the wind come forth
To move oer the world of men 
Othin spake
38
Tenth answer me now 
if thou knowest all
The fate that is fixed for the gods
Whence came up Njorth 
to the kin of the gods
Rich in temples 
and shrines he rules
Though of gods he was never begot 
Vafthruthnir spake
39

And gave him as pledge to the gods
At the fall of the world 
shall he fare once more
Home to the Wanes so wise 
Othin spake

Eleventh answer me well 
What men       
in       home

All healed full soon to sit

Of the fate that is fixed for the gods
Of the runes of the gods 
and the giants race
The truth indeed dost thou tell
And wide is thy wisdom giant 
Vafthruthnir spake
43
Of the runes of the gods 
and the giants race
The truth indeed can I tell
For to every world have I won
To nine worlds came I 
to Niflhel beneath
The home where dead men dwell 
Othin spake
44
Much have I fared 
much have I found
Much have I got of the gods
What shall live of mankind 
when at last there comes
The mighty winter to men 
Vafthruthnir spake
45
In Hoddmimirs wood 
shall hide themselves
Lif and Lifthrasir then
The morning dews 
for meat shall they have
Such food shall men then find 
Othin spake
46
Much have I fared 
much have I found
Much have I got of the gods
Whence comes the sun 
to the smooth sky back
When Fenrir has snatched it forth 
Vafthruthnir spake

A daughter bright 
Alfrothul bears
Ere Fenrir snatches her forth
Her mothers paths 
shall the maiden tread
When the gods to death have gone 
Othin spake
48
Much have I fared  much have I found
Much have I got of the gods
What maidens are they 
so wise of mind
That forth oer the sea shall fare 
Vafthruthnir spake
49
Oer Mogthrasirs hill 
shall the maidens pass
And three are their throngs that come
They all shall protect 
the dwellers on earth
Though they come of the giants kin 
Othin spake

much have I found
Much have I got of the gods
Who then shall rule 
the realm of the gods
When the fires of Surt have sunk 
Vafthruthnir spake

and Vali shall dwell
When the fires of Surt have sunk

much have I found
Much have I got of the gods
What shall bring the doom 
of death to Othin
When the gods to destruction go 
Vafthruthnir spake

The wolf shall fell 
the father of men
And this shall Vithar avenge
The terrible jaws 
shall he tear apart
And so the wolf shall he slay 
Othin spake
54
Much have I fared 
much have I found
Much have I got from the gods
What spake Othin himself 
in the ears of his son
Ere in the balefire he burned 
Vafthruthnir spake
55
No man can tell 
what in olden time
Thou spakst in the ears of thy son
With fated mouth 
the fall of the gods
And mine olden tales have I told 
With Othin in knowledge 
now have I striven
And ever the wiser thou art
