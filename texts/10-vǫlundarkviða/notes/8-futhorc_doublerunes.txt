ᚦere was a kiᛝ in Sweden named Niᚦuᚦ
He had two sons and one daughter
her name was Boᚦvild
ᚦere were ᚦree broᚦers sons of a kiᛝ of ᚦe Finns
one was called Slagfiᚦ anoᚦer Egil ᚦe ᚦird Völund
ᚦey went on snowᛲᛟs and hunted wild bᛠᛥs
ᚦey came into Ulfdalir and ᚦere ᚦey built ᚦemselves a house
ᚦere was a lake ᚦere which is called Ulfsjar
ᛠrly one morniᛝ ᚦey found on ᚦe ᛲore of ᚦe lake ᚦree women who were spinniᛝ flax
Nᛠr ᚦem were ᚦeir swaᛝarments
for ᚦey were Valkyries
Two of ᚦem were daughters of Kiᛝ Hloᚦver Hlaᚦguᚦ ᚦe SwanWhite and Hervor ᚦe All Wise
and ᚦe ᚦird was Olrun daughter of Kjar from Valland
ᚦese did ᚦey briᛝ home to ᚦeir hall wiᚦ ᚦem
Egil tᛳk Olrun and Slagfiᚦ Swan White and Volund AllWise
ᚦere ᚦey dwelt seven winters
but ᚦen ᚦey flew away to find battles and came back no more
ᚦen Egil set forᚦ on his snowᛲᛟs to follow Olrun and Slagfiᚦ followed SwanWhite but Völund ᛥayed in Ulfdalir
He was a moᛥ skillful man as men know from old tales
Kiᛝ Niᚦuᚦ had him taken by force as ᚦe pᛟm here tells
1
Maids from ᚦe souᚦ
ᚦrough Myrkwᛳd flew
Fair and youᛝ
ᚦeir fate to follow
On ᚦe ᛲore of ᚦe sᛠ
to reᛥ ᚦem ᚦey sat
ᚦe maids of ᚦe souᚦ
and flax ᚦey spun
2
Hlaᚦguᚦ and Hervor
Hloᚦvers children
And Olrun ᚦe Wise
Kjars daughter was
3
One in her arms
tᛳk Egil ᚦen
To her bosom white
ᚦe woman fair
4
SwanWhite second
swanfᛠᚦers ᛲe wore
And her arms ᚦe ᚦird
of ᚦe siᛥers ᚦrew
Next round Völunds
neck so white
5
ᚦere did ᚦey sit
for seven winters
In ᚦe eighᚦ at laᛥ
came ᚦeir loᛝiᛝ again
And in ᚦe ninᚦ
did need divide ᚦem
ᚦe maidens yᛠrned
for ᚦe murky wᛳd
ᚦe fair youᛝ maids
ᚦeir fate to follow
6
Völund home
from his huntiᛝ came
From a wᛠry way
ᚦe wᛠᚦerwise bowman
Slagfiᚦ and Egil
ᚦe hall found empty
Out and in went ᚦey
everywhere seekiᛝ
7
ᛠᛥ fared Egil
after Olrun
And Slagfiᚦ souᚦ
to seek for SwanWhite
Völund alone
in Ulfdalir lay
8
Red gold he faᛲioned
wiᚦ faireᛥ gems
And riᛝs he ᛥruᛝ
on ropes of baᛥ
So for his wife
he waited loᛝ
If ᚦe fair one home
might come to him
9
ᚦis Niᚦuᚦ lᛠrned
ᚦe lord of ᚦe Njars
ᚦat Völund alone
in Ulfdalir lay
By night went his men
ᚦeir mailcoats were ᛥudded
ᚦeir ᛲields in ᚦe waniᛝ
mᛳnlight ᛲone
10
From ᚦeir saddles ᚦe gable
wall ᚦey sought
And in ᚦey went
at ᚦe end of ᚦe hall
Riᛝs ᚦey saw ᚦere
on ropes of baᛥ
Seven hundred
ᚦe hero had
11
Off ᚦey tᛳk ᚦem
but all ᚦey left
Save one alone
which ᚦey bore away
12
Völund home
from his huntiᛝ came
From a wᛠry way
ᚦe wᛠᚦerwise bowman
A brown bᛠrs fleᛲ
would he roaᛥ wiᚦ fire
Sᛳn ᚦe wᛳd so dry
was burniᛝ well
ᚦe winddried wᛳd
ᚦat Völunds was
13
On ᚦe bᛠrskin he reᛥed
and counted ᚦe riᛝs
ᚦe maᛥer of elves
but one he missed
ᚦat Hloᚦvers daughter
had it he ᚦought
And ᚦe allwise maid
had come once more
14
So loᛝ he sat
ᚦat he fell asleep
His wakiᛝ empty
of gladness was
Hᛠvy chains
he saw on his hands
And fetters bound
his feet togeᚦer
Völund spake
15
What men are ᚦey
who ᚦus have laid
Ropes of baᛥ
to bind me now
ᚦen Niᚦuᚦ called
ᚦe lord of ᚦe Njars
How gotteᛥ ᚦou Völund
grᛠteᛥ of elves
ᚦese trᛠsures of ours
in Ulfdalir
Volund spake
16
ᚦe gold was not
on Granis way
Far meᚦinks is our rᛠlm
from ᚦe hills of ᚦe Rhine
I mind me ᚦat trᛠsures
more we had
When happy togeᚦer
at home we were
17
Wiᚦout ᛥᛳd ᚦe wife
of Niᚦuᚦ wise
And in ᛲe came
from ᚦe end of ᚦe hall
On ᚦe flᛳr ᛲe ᛥᛳd
and softly spoke
Not kind dᛟs he lᛳk
who comes from ᚦe wᛳd
Kiᛝ Niᚦuᚦ gave to his daughter Boᚦvild ᚦe gold riᛝ ᚦat he had taken from ᚦe baᛥ rope in Völunds house and he himself wore ᚦe sword ᚦat Völund had had
ᚦe queen spake
18
ᚦe glow of his eyes
is like glᛠmiᛝ snakes
His teeᚦ he gnaᛲes
if now is ᛲown
ᚦe sword or Boᚦvilds
riᛝ he sees
Let ᚦem ᛥraightway cut
his sinews of ᛥreᛝᚦ
And set him ᚦen
in Sᚫvarᛥaᚦ
So was it done ᚦe sinews in his kneejoints were cut and he was set in an island which was nᛠr ᚦe mainland and was called Sᚫvarᛥaᚦ
ᚦere he smiᚦied for ᚦe kiᛝ all kinds of precious ᚦiᛝs
No man dared to go to him save only ᚦe kiᛝ himself
Völund spake
19
At Niᚦuᚦs girdle
glᛠms ᚦe sword
ᚦat I ᛲarpened keen
wiᚦ cunniᛝeᛥ craft
And hardened ᚦe ᛥeel
wiᚦ higheᛥ skill
ᚦe bright blade far
forever is borne
Nor back ᛲall I see it
borne to my smiᚦy
Now Boᚦvild gets
ᚦe golden riᛝ
ᚦat was once my brides
neer well ᛲall it be
20
He sat nor slept
and smote wiᚦ his hammer
Faᛥ for Niᚦuᚦ
wonders he faᛲioned
Two boys did go
in his dᛳr to gaze
Niᚦuᚦs sons
into Sᚫvarᛥaᚦ
21
ᚦey came to ᚦe cheᛥ
and ᚦey craved ᚦe keys
ᚦe evil was open
when in ᚦey lᛳked
To ᚦe boys it seemed
ᚦat gems ᚦey saw
Gold in plenty
and precious ᛥones
Völund spake
22
Come ye alone
ᚦe next day come
Gold to you boᚦ
ᛲall ᚦen be given
Tell not ᚦe maids
or ᚦe men of ᚦe hall
To no one say
ᚦat me you have sought
23
ᛠrly did broᚦer
to broᚦer call
Swift let us go
ᚦe riᛝs to see
24
ᚦey came to ᚦe cheᛥ
and ᚦey craved ᚦe keys
ᚦe evil was open
when in ᚦey lᛳked
He smote off ᚦeir hᛠds
and ᚦeir feet he hid
Under ᚦe sᛳty
ᛥraps of ᚦe bellows
25
ᚦeir skulls once hid
by ᚦeir hair he tᛳk
Set ᚦem in silver
and sent ᚦem to Niᚦuᚦ
Gems full fair
from ᚦeir eyes he faᛲioned
To Niᚦuᚦs wife
so wise he gave ᚦem
26
And from ᚦe teeᚦ
of ᚦe twain he wrought
A brᛳch for ᚦe brᛠᛥ
to Boᚦvild he sent it
27
Boᚦvild ᚦen
of her riᛝ did boaᛥ
ᚦe riᛝ I have broken
I dare not say it
save to ᚦee
Völund spake
28
I ᛲall weld ᚦe brᛠk
in ᚦe gold so well
ᚦat fairer ᚦan ever
ᚦy faᚦer ᛲall find it
And better much
ᚦy moᚦer ᛲall ᚦink it
And ᚦou no worse
ᚦan ever it was
29
Beer he brought
he was better in cunniᛝ
Until in her sᛠt
full sᛳn ᛲe slept
Völund spake
Now veᛝᛠnce I have
for all my hurts
Save one alone
on ᚦe evil woman
30
Quoᚦ Volund Would
ᚦat well were ᚦe sinews
Maimed in my feet
by Niᚦuᚦs men
31
Laughiᛝ Völund
rose aloft
Weepiᛝ Boᚦvild
went from ᚦe isle
For her lovers flight
and her faᚦers wraᚦ
32
Wiᚦout ᛥᛳd ᚦe wife
of Niᚦuᚦ wise
And in ᛲe came
from ᚦe end of ᚦe hall
But he by ᚦe wall
in wᛠriness sat
Wakeᛥ ᚦou Niᚦuᚦ
lord of ᚦe Njars
Niᚦuᚦ spake
33
Always I wake
and ever joyless
Little I sleep
since my sons were slain
Cold is my hᛠd
cold was ᚦy counsel
One ᚦiᛝ wiᚦ Völund
to spᛠk I wiᛲ
34
Answer me Völund
grᛠteᛥ of elves
What happed wiᚦ my boys
ᚦat hale once were
Volund spake
35
Firᛥ ᛲalt ᚦou all
ᚦe oaᚦs now swᛠr
By ᚦe rail of ᛲip
and ᚦe rim of ᛲield
By ᚦe ᛲoulder of ᛥeed
and ᚦe edge of sword
ᚦat to Völunds wife
ᚦou wilt work no ill
Nor yet my bride
to her dᛠᚦ wilt briᛝ
ᚦough a wife I ᛲould have
ᚦat well ᚦou knoweᛥ
And a child I ᛲould have
wiᚦin ᚦy hall
36
Seek ᚦe smiᚦy
ᚦat ᚦou didᛥ set
ᚦou ᛲalt find ᚦe bellows
sprinkled wiᚦ blᛳd
I smote off ᚦe hᛠds
of boᚦ ᚦy sons
And ᚦeir feet nᛠᚦ ᚦe sᛳty
ᛥraps I hid
37
ᚦeir skulls once hid
by ᚦeir hair I tᛳk
Set ᚦem in silver
and sent ᚦem to Niᚦuᚦ
Gems full fair
from ᚦeir eyes I faᛲioned
To Niᚦuᚦs wife
so wise I gave ᚦem
38
And from ᚦe teeᚦ
of ᚦe twain I wrought
A brᛳch for ᚦe brᛠᛥ
to Boᚦvild I gave it
Now big wiᚦ child
dᛟs Boᚦvild go
ᚦe only daughter
ye two had ever
Niᚦuᚦ spake
39
Never spakeᛥ ᚦou word
ᚦat worse could hurt me
Nor ᚦat made me Völund
more bitter for veᛝᛠnce
ᚦere is no man so high
from ᚦy horse to take ᚦee
Or so doughty an archer
as down to ᛲᛳt ᚦee
While high in ᚦe clouds
ᚦy course ᚦou takeᛥ
40
Laughiᛝ Völund
rose aloft
But left in sadness
Niᚦuᚦ sat
41
ᚦen spake Niᚦuᚦ
lord of ᚦe Njars
Rise up ᚦakkraᚦ
beᛥ of my ᚦralls
Bid Boᚦvild come
ᚦe brightbrowed maid
Bedecked so fair
wiᚦ her faᚦer to spᛠk
42
Is it true Boᚦvild
ᚦat which was told me
Once in ᚦe isle
wiᚦ Völund wert ᚦou
Boᚦvild spake
43
True is it Niᚦuᚦ
ᚦat which was told ᚦee
Once in ᚦe isle
wiᚦ Völund was I
An hour of luᛥ
alas it ᛲould be
Nought was my might
wiᚦ such a man
Nor from his ᛥreᛝᚦ
could I save myself
