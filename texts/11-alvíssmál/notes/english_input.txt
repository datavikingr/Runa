Alvis spake:
1.
"Now shall the bride |
my benches adorn,
And homeward haste forthwith;
Eager for wedlock |
to all shall I seem,
Nor at home shall they rob me of rest." 
Thor spake:
2.
"What, pray, art thou? |
Why so pale round the nose?
By the dead hast thou lain of late?
To a giant like |
dost thou look, methinks;
Thou wast not born for the bride." 
Alvis spake:
3.
"Alvis am I, |
and under the earth
My home ‘neath the rocks I have;
With the wagon-guider |
a word do I seek,
Let the gods their bond not break." 
Thor spake:
4.
"Break it shall I, |
for over the bride
Her father has foremost right;
At home was I not |
when the promise thou hadst,
And I give her alone of the gods." 
Alvis spake:
5.
"What hero claims |
such right to hold
O‘er the bride that shines so bright?
Not many will know thee, |
thou wandering man!
Who was bought with rings to bear thee?" 
Thor spake:
6.
"Vingthor, the wanderer |
wide, am I,
And I am Sithgrani‘s son;
Against my will |
shalt thou get the maid,
And win the marriage word." 
Alvis spake:
7.
"Thy good-will now |
shall I quickly get,
And win the marriage word;
I long to have, |
and I would not lack,
This snow-white maid for mine." 
Thor spake:
8.
"The love of the maid |
I may not keep thee
From winning, thou guest so wise,
If of every world |
thou canst tell me all
That now I wish to know. 
9.
