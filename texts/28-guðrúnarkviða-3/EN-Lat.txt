Herkja was the name of a serving-woman of Atli's; 
she had been his concubine. 
She told Atli that she had seen Thjothrek and Guthrun both together. 
Atli was greatly angered thereby. 
Then Guthrun said: 

1.
"What thy sorrow, Atli, |
Buthli's son?
Is thy heart heavy-laden? |
Why laughest thou never?
It would better befit |
the warrior far
To speak with men, |
and me to look on." 
Atli spake:

2.
"It troubles me, Guthrun, |
Gjuki's daughter,
What Herkja here |
in the hall hath told me,
That thou in the bed |
with Thjothrek liest,
Beneath the linen |
in lovers' guise." 
Guthrun spake:

3.
"This shall I |
with oaths now swear,
Swear by the sacred |
stone so white,
That nought was there |
with Thjothmar's son
That man or woman |
may not know. 

4.
"Nor ever once |
did my arms embrace
The hero brave, |
the leader of hosts;
In another manner |
our meeting was,
When our sorrows we |
in secret told. 

5.
"With thirty warriors |
Thjothrek came,
Nor of all his men |
doth one remain;
Thou hast murdered my brothers |
and mail-clad men,
Thou hast murdered all |
the men of my race. 

6.
"Gunnar comes not, |
Hogni I greet not,
No longer I see |
my brothers loved;
My sorrow would Hogni |
avenge with the sword,
Now myself for my woes |
I shall payment win.

7.
"Summon Saxi, |
the southrons' king,
For be the boiling |
kettle can hallow."
Seven hundred |
there were in the hall,
Ere the queen her hand |
in the kettle thrust. 

8.
To the bottom she reached |
with hand so bright,
And forth she brought |
the flashing stones:
"Behold, ye warriors, |
well am I cleared
Of sin by the kettle's |
sacred boiling." 

9.
Then Atli's heart |
in happiness laughed,
When Guthrun's hand |
unhurt he saw;
"Now Herkja shall come |
the kettle to try,
She who grief |
for Guthrun planned." 

10.
Ne'er saw man sight |
more sad than this,
How burned were the hands |
of Herkja then;
In a bog so foul |
the maid they flung,
And so was Guthrun's |
grief requited.
