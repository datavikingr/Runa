Herkja was the name of a servingwoman of Atlis 
she had been his concubine 
She told Atli that she had seen Thjothrek and Guthrun both together 
Atli was greatly angered thereby 
Then Guthrun said 
1
What thy sorrow Atli 
Buthlis son
Is thy heart heavyladen 
Why laughest thou never
It would better befit 
the warrior far
To speak with men 
and me to look on 
Atli spake
2
It troubles me Guthrun 
Gjukis daughter
What Herkja here 
in the hall hath told me
That thou in the bed 
with Thjothrek liest
Beneath the linen 
in lovers guise 
Guthrun spake
3
This shall I 
with oaths now swear
Swear by the sacred 
stone so white
That nought was there 
with Thjothmars son
That man or woman 
may not know 
4
Nor ever once 
did my arms embrace
The hero brave 
the leader of hosts
In another manner 
our meeting was
When our sorrows we 
in secret told 
5
With thirty warriors 
Thjothrek came
Nor of all his men 
doth one remain
Thou hast murdered my brothers 
and mailclad men
Thou hast murdered all 
the men of my race 
6
Gunnar comes not 
Hogni I greet not
No longer I see 
my brothers loved
My sorrow would Hogni 
avenge with the sword
Now myself for my woes 
I shall payment win
7
Summon Saxi 
the southrons king
For be the boiling 
kettle can hallow
Seven hundred 
there were in the hall
Ere the queen her hand 
in the kettle thrust 
8
To the bottom she reached 
with hand so bright
And forth she brought 
the flashing stones
Behold ye warriors 
well am I cleared
Of sin by the kettles 
sacred boiling 
9
Then Atlis heart 
in happiness laughed
When Guthruns hand 
unhurt he saw
Now Herkja shall come 
the kettle to try
She who grief 
for Guthrun planned 
10
Neer saw man sight 
more sad than this
How burned were the hands 
of Herkja then
In a bog so foul 
the maid they flung
And so was Guthruns 
grief requited
