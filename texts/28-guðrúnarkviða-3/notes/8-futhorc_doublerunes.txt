1
What ᚦy sorrow Atli
Buᚦlis son
Is ᚦy hᛠrt hᛠvyladen
Why laugheᛥ ᚦou never
It would better befit

To spᛠk wiᚦ men
and me to lᛳk on
Atli spake
2
It troubles me Guᚦrun
Gjukis daughter
What Herkja here
in ᚦe hall haᚦ told me
ᚦat ᚦou in ᚦe bed
wiᚦ ᚦjoᚦrek lieᛥ
Benᛠᚦ ᚦe linen
in lovers guise
Guᚦrun spake
3
ᚦis ᛲall I

Swᛠr by ᚦe sacred
ᛥone so white
ᚦat nought was ᚦere
wiᚦ ᚦjoᚦmars son
ᚦat man or woman
may not know
4
Nor ever once
did my arms embrace
ᚦe hero brave
ᚦe lᛠder of hoᛥs
In anoᚦer manner
our meetiᛝ was
When our sorrows we
in secret told
5
Wiᚦ ᚦirty warriors
ᚦjoᚦrek came
Nor of all his men
doᚦ one remain
ᚦou haᛥ murdered my broᚦers
and mailclad men
ᚦou haᛥ murdered all
ᚦe men of my race
6
Gunnar comes not
Hogni I greet not
No loᛝer I see

My sorrow would Hogni
aveᛝe wiᚦ ᚦe sword
Now myself for my wᛟs
I ᛲall payment win
7
Summon Saxi

For be ᚦe boiliᛝ

Seven hundred

Ere ᚦe queen her hand

8
To ᚦe bottom ᛲe rᛠched
wiᚦ hand so bright
And forᚦ ᛲe brought
ᚦe flaᛲiᛝ ᛥones
Behold ye warriors

Of sin by ᚦe kettles
sacred boiliᛝ
9
ᚦen Atlis hᛠrt
in happiness laughed
When Guᚦruns hand
unhurt he saw
Now Herkja ᛲall come
ᚦe kettle to try
ᛲe who grief
for Guᚦrun planned
10
Neer saw man sight
more sad ᚦan ᚦis
How burned were ᚦe hands
of Herkja ᚦen
In a bog so foul
ᚦe maid ᚦey fluᛝ
And so was Guᚦruns
grief requited
