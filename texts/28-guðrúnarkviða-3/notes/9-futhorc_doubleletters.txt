2
It troubles me Guᚦrun

3

4
Nor ever once
did my arms embrace
ᚦe hero brave
ᚦe lᛠder of hoᛥs
In anoᚦer maner
our metiᛝ was
When our sorows we
in secret told
5
Wiᚦ ᚦirty wariors

9
ᚦen Atlis hᛠrt
in hapines laughed
When Guᚦruns hand

10
Ner saw man sight

How burned were ᚦe hands
of Herkja ᚦen
In a bog so foul
ᚦe maid ᚦey fluᛝ
And so was Guᚦruns
grief requited
