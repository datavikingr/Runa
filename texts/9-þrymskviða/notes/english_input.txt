1.
Wild was Vingthor |
when he awoke,
And when his mighty |
hammer he missed;
He shook his beard, |
his hair was bristling,
As the son of Jorth |
about him sought. 
2.
Hear now the speech |
that first he spake:
"Harken, Loki, |
and heed my words,
Nowhere on earth |
is it known to man,
Nor in heaven above: |
our hammer is stolen." 
3.
To the dwelling fair |
of Freyja went they,
Hear now the speech |
that first he spake:
"Wilt thou, Freyja, |
thy feather-dress lend me,
That so my hammer |
I may seek?" 
Freyja spake:
4.
"Thine should it be |
though of silver bright,
And I would give it |
though 'twere of gold." 
Then Loki flew, |
and the feather-dress whirred,
Till he left behind him |
the home of the gods,
And reached at last |
the realm of the giants. 
5.
Thrym sat on a mound, |
the giants' master,
Leashes of gold |
he laid for his dogs,
And stroked and smoothed |
the manes of his steeds. 
Thrym spake:
6.
"How fare the gods, |
how fare the elves?
Why comst thou alone |
to the giants' land?"
Loki spake:
"Ill fare the gods, |
ill fare the elves!
Hast thou hidden |
Hlorrithi's hammer?" 
Thrym spake:
7.
"I have hidden |
Hlorrithi's hammer,
Eight miles down |
deep in the earth;
And back again |
shall no man bring it
If Freyja I win not |
to be my wife." 
8.
Then Loki flew, |
and the feather-dress whirred,
Till he left behind him |
the home of the giants,
And reached at last |
the realm of the gods.
There in the courtyard |
Thor he met:
Hear now the speech |
that first he spake: 
9.
"Hast thou found tidings |
as well as trouble?
Thy news in the air |
shalt thou utter now;
Oft doth the sitter |
his story forget,
And lies he speaks |
who lays himself down." 
Loki spake:
10.
"Trouble I have, |
and tidings as well:
Thrym, king of the giants, |
keeps thy hammer,
And back again |
shall no man bring it
If Freyja he wins not |
to be his wife." 
11.
Freyja the fair |
then went they to find;
Hear now the speech |
that first he spake:
"Bind on, Freyja, |
the bridal veil,
For we two must haste |
to the giants' home." 
12.
Wrathful was Freyja, |
and fiercely she snorted,
And the dwelling great |
of the gods was shaken,
And burst was the mighty |
Brisings' necklace:
"Most lustful indeed |
should I look to all
If I journeyed with thee |
to the giants' home." 
13.
Then were the gods |
together met,
And the goddesses came |
and council held,
And the far-famed ones |
a plan would find,
How they might Hlorrithi's |
hammer win. 
14.
Then Heimdall spake, |
whitest of the gods,
Like the Wanes he knew |
the future well:
"Bind we on Thor |
the bridal veil,
Let him bear the mighty |
Brisings' necklace; 
15.
"Keys around him |
let there rattle,
And down to his knees |
hang woman's dress;
With gems full broad |
upon his breast,
And a pretty cap |
to crown his head." 
16.
Then Thor the mighty |
his answer made:
"Me would the gods |
unmanly call
If I let bind |
the bridal veil." 
17.
Then Loki spake, |
the son of Laufey:
"Be silent, Thor, |
and speak not thus;
Else will the giants |
in Asgarth dwell
If thy hammer is brought not |
home to thee." 
18.
Then bound they on Thor |
the bridal veil,
And next the mighty |
Brisings' necklace.
19.
Keys around him |
let they rattle,
And down to his knees |
hung woman's dress;
With gems full broad |
upon his breast,
And a pretty cap |
to crown his head. 
20.
Then Loki spake, |
the son of Laufey:
"As thy maid-servant thither |
I go with thee;
We two shall haste |
to the giants' home." 
21.
Then home the goats |
to the hall were driven,
They wrenched at the halters, |
swift were they to run;
The mountains burst, |
earth burned with fire,
And Othin's son |
sought Jotunheim. 
22.
Then loud spake Thrym, |
the giants' leader:
"Bestir ye, giants, |
put straw on the benches;
Now Freyja they bring |
to be my bride,
The daughter of Njorth |
out of Noatun. 
23.
"Gold-horned cattle |
go to my stables,
Jet-black oxen, |
the giant's joy;
Many my gems, |
and many my jewels,
Freyja alone |
did I lack, methinks." 
24.
Early it was |
to evening come,
And forth was borne |
the beer for the giants;
Thor alone ate an ox, |
and eight salmon,
All the dainties as well |
that were set for the women;
And drank Sif's mate |
three tuns of mead. 
25.
Then loud spake Thrym, |
the giants' leader:
"Who ever saw bride |
more keenly bite?
I ne'er saw bride |
with a broader bite,
Nor a maiden who drank |
more mead than this!" 
26.
Hard by there sat |
the serving-maid wise,
So well she answered |
the giant's words:
"From food has Freyja |
eight nights fasted,
So hot was her longing |
for Jotunheim." 
27.
Thrym looked 'neath the veil, |
for he longed to kiss,
But back he leaped |
the length of the hall:
"Why are so fearful |
the eyes of Freyja?
Fire, methinks, |
from her eyes burns forth." 
28.
Hard by there sat |
the serving-maid wise,
So well she answered |
the giant's words:
"No sleep has Freyja |
for eight nights found,
So hot was her longing |
for Jotunheim." 
29.
Soon came the giant's |
luckless sister,
Who feared not to ask |
the bridal fee:
"From thy hands the rings |
of red gold take,
If thou wouldst win |
my willing love,
(My willing love |
and welcome glad.)" 
30.
Then loud spake Thrym, |
the giants' leader:
"Bring in the hammer |
to hallow the bride;
On the maiden's knees |
let Mjollnir lie,
That us both the band |
of Vor may bless." 
31.
The heart in the breast |
of Hlorrithi laughed
When the hard-souled one |
his hammer beheld;
First Thrym, the king |
of the giants, he killed,
Then all the folk |
of the giants he felled. 
32.
The giant's sister |
old he slew,
She who had begged |
the bridal fee;
A stroke she got |
in the shilling's stead,
And for many rings |
the might of the hammer. 
33.
And so his hammer |
got Othin's son.
