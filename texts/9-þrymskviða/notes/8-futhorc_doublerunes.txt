Wild was Viᛝᚦor
when he awoke
And when his mighty
hammer he missed
He ᛲᛳk his bᛠrd
his hair was briᛥliᛝ
As ᚦe son of Jorᚦ
about him sought
2
Hᛠr now ᚦe speech
ᚦat firᛥ he spake
Harken Loki
and heed my words
Nowhere on ᛠrᚦ
is it known to man
Nor in hᛠven above
our hammer is ᛥolen
3
To ᚦe dwelliᛝ fair
of Freyja went ᚦey
Hᛠr now ᚦe speech
ᚦat firᛥ he spake
Wilt ᚦou Freyja
ᚦy fᛠᚦerdress lend me
ᚦat so my hammer
I may seek
Freyja spake
4
ᚦine ᛲould it be
ᚦough of silver bright
And I would give it
ᚦough twere of gold
ᚦen Loki flew
and ᚦe fᛠᚦerdress whirred
Till he left behind him
ᚦe home of ᚦe gods
And rᛠched at laᛥ
ᚦe rᛠlm of ᚦe giants
5
ᚦrym sat on a mound
ᚦe giants maᛥer
Lᛠᛲes of gold
he laid for his dogs
And ᛥroked and smᛳᚦed
ᚦe manes of his ᛥeeds
ᚦrym spake
6
How fare ᚦe gods
how fare ᚦe elves
Why comᛥ ᚦou alone
to ᚦe giants land
Loki spake
Ill fare ᚦe gods
ill fare ᚦe elves
Haᛥ ᚦou hidden
Hlorriᚦis hammer
ᚦrym spake
7
I have hidden
Hlorriᚦis hammer
Eight miles down
deep in ᚦe ᛠrᚦ
And back again
ᛲall no man briᛝ it
If Freyja I win not
to be my wife
8
ᚦen Loki flew
and ᚦe fᛠᚦerdress whirred
Till he left behind him
ᚦe home of ᚦe giants
And rᛠched at laᛥ
ᚦe rᛠlm of ᚦe gods
ᚦere in ᚦe courtyard
ᚦor he met
Hᛠr now ᚦe speech
ᚦat firᛥ he spake
9
Haᛥ ᚦou found tidiᛝs
as well as trouble
ᚦy news in ᚦe air
ᛲalt ᚦou utter now
Oft doᚦ ᚦe sitter
his ᛥory forget
And lies he spᛠks
who lays himself down
Loki spake
10
Trouble I have
and tidiᛝs as well
ᚦrym kiᛝ of ᚦe giants
keeps ᚦy hammer
And back again
ᛲall no man briᛝ it
If Freyja he wins not
to be his wife
11
Freyja ᚦe fair
ᚦen went ᚦey to find
Hᛠr now ᚦe speech
ᚦat firᛥ he spake
Bind on Freyja
ᚦe bridal veil
For we two muᛥ haᛥe
to ᚦe giants home
12
Wraᚦful was Freyja
and fiercely ᛲe snorted
And ᚦe dwelliᛝ grᛠt
of ᚦe gods was ᛲaken
And burᛥ was ᚦe mighty
Brisiᛝs necklace
Moᛥ luᛥful indeed
ᛲould I lᛳk to all
If I journeyed wiᚦ ᚦee
to ᚦe giants home
13
ᚦen were ᚦe gods
togeᚦer met
And ᚦe goddesses came
and council held
And ᚦe farfamed ones
a plan would find
How ᚦey might Hlorriᚦis
hammer win
14
ᚦen Heimdall spake
whiteᛥ of ᚦe gods
Like ᚦe Wanes he knew
ᚦe future well
Bind we on ᚦor
ᚦe bridal veil
Let him bᛠr ᚦe mighty
Brisiᛝs necklace
15
Keys around him
let ᚦere rattle
And down to his knees
haᛝ womans dress
Wiᚦ gems full broad
upon his brᛠᛥ
And a pretty cap
to crown his hᛠd
16
ᚦen ᚦor ᚦe mighty
his answer made
Me would ᚦe gods
unmanly call
If I let bind
ᚦe bridal veil
17
ᚦen Loki spake
ᚦe son of Laufey
Be silent ᚦor
and spᛠk not ᚦus
Else will ᚦe giants
in Asgarᚦ dwell
If ᚦy hammer is brought not
home to ᚦee
18
ᚦen bound ᚦey on ᚦor
ᚦe bridal veil
And next ᚦe mighty
Brisiᛝs necklace
19
Keys around him
let ᚦey rattle
And down to his knees
huᛝ womans dress
Wiᚦ gems full broad
upon his brᛠᛥ
And a pretty cap
to crown his hᛠd
20
ᚦen Loki spake
ᚦe son of Laufey
As ᚦy maidservant ᚦiᚦer
I go wiᚦ ᚦee
We two ᛲall haᛥe
to ᚦe giants home
21
ᚦen home ᚦe goats
to ᚦe hall were driven
ᚦey wrenched at ᚦe halters
swift were ᚦey to run
ᚦe mountains burᛥ
ᛠrᚦ burned wiᚦ fire
And Oᚦins son
sought Jotunheim
22
ᚦen loud spake ᚦrym
ᚦe giants lᛠder
Beᛥir ye giants
put ᛥraw on ᚦe benches
Now Freyja ᚦey briᛝ
to be my bride
ᚦe daughter of Njorᚦ
out of Noatun
23
Goldhorned cattle
go to my ᛥables
Jetblack oxen
ᚦe giants joy
Many my gems
and many my jewels
Freyja alone
did I lack meᚦinks
24
ᛠrly it was
to eveniᛝ come
And forᚦ was borne
ᚦe beer for ᚦe giants
ᚦor alone ate an ox
and eight salmon
All ᚦe dainties as well
ᚦat were set for ᚦe women
And drank Sifs mate
ᚦree tuns of mᛠd
25
ᚦen loud spake ᚦrym
ᚦe giants lᛠder
Who ever saw bride
more keenly bite
I neer saw bride
wiᚦ a broader bite
Nor a maiden who drank
more mᛠd ᚦan ᚦis
26
Hard by ᚦere sat
ᚦe serviᛝmaid wise
So well ᛲe answered
ᚦe giants words
From fᛳd has Freyja
eight nights faᛥed
So hot was her loᛝiᛝ
for Jotunheim
27
ᚦrym lᛳked nᛠᚦ ᚦe veil
for he loᛝed to kiss
But back he lᛠped
ᚦe leᛝᚦ of ᚦe hall
Why are so fᛠrful
ᚦe eyes of Freyja
Fire meᚦinks
from her eyes burns forᚦ
28
Hard by ᚦere sat
ᚦe serviᛝmaid wise
So well ᛲe answered
ᚦe giants words
No sleep has Freyja
for eight nights found
So hot was her loᛝiᛝ
for Jotunheim
29
Sᛳn came ᚦe giants
luckless siᛥer
Who fᛠred not to ask
ᚦe bridal fee
From ᚦy hands ᚦe riᛝs
of red gold take
If ᚦou wouldᛥ win
my williᛝ love
My williᛝ love
and welcome glad
30
ᚦen loud spake ᚦrym
ᚦe giants lᛠder
Briᛝ in ᚦe hammer
to hallow ᚦe bride
On ᚦe maidens knees
let Mjollnir lie
ᚦat us boᚦ ᚦe band
of Vor may bless
31
ᚦe hᛠrt in ᚦe brᛠᛥ
of Hlorriᚦi laughed
When ᚦe hardsouled one
his hammer beheld
Firᛥ ᚦrym ᚦe kiᛝ
of ᚦe giants he killed
ᚦen all ᚦe folk
of ᚦe giants he felled
32
ᚦe giants siᛥer
old he slew
ᛲe who had begged
ᚦe bridal fee
A ᛥroke ᛲe got
in ᚦe ᛲilliᛝs ᛥᛠd
And for many riᛝs
ᚦe might of ᚦe hammer
33
And so his hammer
got Oᚦins son
