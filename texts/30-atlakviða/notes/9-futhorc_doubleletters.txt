Guᚦrun Gjukis daughter aveᛝed her broᚦers as has become wel known
ᛲe slew firᛥ Atlis sons and ᚦerᛠfter ᛲe slew Atli and burned ᚦe hal wiᚦ his whole company
Concerniᛝ ᚦis was ᚦe folowiᛝ pᛟm made
1
Atli sent
of old to Gunar
A kenwited rider
Knefröᚦ did men cal him
To Gjukis home came he
and to Gunars dweliᛝ
Wiᚦ benches round ᚦe hᛠrᚦ
and to ᚦe ber so swet
2
ᚦen ᚦe folowers hidiᛝ
ᚦeir falsenes al drank
ᚦeir wine in ᚦe warhal
of ᚦe Huns wraᚦ wary
And Knefröᚦ spake loudly
his words were crafty
ᚦe hero from ᚦe souᚦ
on ᚦe high bench sitiᛝ
3
Now Atli has sent me
his erand to ride
On my bitchampiᛝ ᛥed
ᚦrough Myrkwᛳd ᚦe secret
To bid you Gunar
to his benches to come
Wiᚦ helms round ᚦe hᛠrᚦ
and Atlis home sek
4
ᛲields ᛲal ye chᛳse ᚦere
and ᛲafts made of aᛲwᛳd
Goldadorned helmets
and slaves out of Hunland
Silvergilt sadlecloᚦs
ᛲirts of bright scarlet
Wiᚦ lances and spᛠrs tᛳ
and bitchampiᛝ ᛥeds
5
ᚦe field ᛲal be given you
of wide Gnitaheiᚦ
Wiᚦ loudriᛝiᛝ lances
and ᛥems goldᛟrlaid
Trᛠsures ful huge
and ᚦe home of Danp
And ᚦe mighty foreᛥ
ᚦat Myrkwᛳd is caled
6
His hᛠd turned Gunar
and to Hogni he said
What ᚦy counsel youᛝ hero
when such ᚦiᛝs we hᛠr
No gold do I know
on Gnitaheiᚦ lyiᛝ
So fair ᚦat oᚦer
its equal we have not
7
We have seven hals
ᛠch of swords is ful
And al of gold
is ᚦe hilt of ᛠch
My ᛥed is ᚦe swifteᛥ
my sword is ᛲarpeᛥ
My bows adorn benches
my byrnies are golden
My helm is ᚦe brighteᛥ
ᚦat came from Kjars hal
Mine own is beter
ᚦan al ᚦe Huns trᛠsure
Hogni spake
8
What seks ᛲe to say
ᚦat ᛲe sends us a riᛝ
Woven wiᚦ a wolfs hair
meᚦinks it gives warniᛝ
In ᚦe red riᛝ a hair
of ᚦe hᛠᚦdweler found I
Wolflike ᛲal our road be
if we ride on ᚦis journey
9
Not ᛠger were his comrades
nor ᚦe men of his kin
ᚦe wise nor ᚦe wary
nor ᚦe wariors bold
But Gunar spake forᚦ
as befited a kiᛝ
Noble in ᚦe berhal
and biter his scorn
10
ᛥand forᚦ now Fjornir
and hiᚦer on ᚦe flᛳr
ᚦe bᛠkers al golden
ᛲalt ᚦou briᛝ to ᚦe wariors
1
ᚦe wolves ᚦen ᛲal rule
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ of ᚦe Nifluᛝs
Wolves aged and greyhued
if Gunar is loᛥ
And blackcoated bᛠrs
wiᚦ rendiᛝ teᚦ bite
And make glad ᚦe dogs
if Gunar returns not
12
A folowiᛝ galant
fared forᚦ wiᚦ ᚦe ruler
Yet ᚦey wept as ᚦeir home
wiᚦ ᚦe hero ᚦey left
And ᚦe litle heir
of Hogni caled loudly
Go safe now ye wise ones
wherever ye wil
13
ᚦen let ᚦe bold herᛟs
ᚦeir bitchampiᛝ horses
On ᚦe mountains galop
and ᚦrough Myrkwᛳd ᚦe secret
Al Hunland was ᛲaken
where ᚦe hardsouled ones rode
On ᚦe whipfᛠrers fared ᚦey
ᚦrough fields ᚦat were gren
14
ᚦen ᚦey saw Atlis hals
and his watchtowers high
On ᚦe wals so lofty
ᛥᛳd ᚦe wariors of Buᚦli
ᚦe hal of ᚦe souᚦrons
wiᚦ sᛠts was surounded
Wiᚦ targets bound
and ᛲields ful bright
15
Mid wᛠpons and lances
did Atli his wine
In ᚦe warhal drink
wiᚦout were his watchmen
For Gunar ᚦey waited
if forᚦ he ᛲould go
Wiᚦ ᚦeir riᛝiᛝ spᛠrs
ᚦey would fight wiᚦ ᚦe ruler
16
ᚦis ᚦeir siᛥer saw
as sᛳn as her broᚦers
Had entered ᚦe hal
litle ale had ᛲe drunk
Betrayed art ᚦou Gunar
what guard haᛥ ᚦou hero
Gainᛥ ᚦe plots of ᚦe Huns
from ᚦe hal fle swiftly
17
Broᚦer twere far beter
to have come in byrnie
Wiᚦ ᚦy household helmed
to se Atlis home
And to sit in ᚦe sadle
al day nᛠᚦ ᚦe sun
ᚦat ᚦe swordnorns might wep
for ᚦe dᛠᚦpale wariors
And ᚦe Huniᛲ ᛲieldmaids
might ᛲun not ᚦe sword
And send Atli himself
to ᚦe den of ᚦe snakes
Now ᚦe den of ᚦe snakes
for ᚦe is deᛥined
Gunar spake
18
Tᛳ late is it siᛥer
to sumon ᚦe Nifluᛝs
Loᛝ is it to come
to ᚦe ᚦroᛝ of our comrades
ᚦe herᛟs galant
from ᚦe hils of ᚦe Rhine
19
ᚦen Gunar ᚦey seized
and ᚦey set him in chains
ᚦe Burgundians kiᛝ
and faᛥ ᚦey bound him
20
Hogni slew seven
wiᚦ sword so ken
And an eighᚦ he fluᛝ
in ᚦe fire hot
A hero ᛲould fight
wiᚦ his fᛟmen ᚦus
As Hogni ᛥrove
in Gunars behalf
21
ᚦe lᛠder ᚦey asked
if his life he fain
Wiᚦ gold would buy
ᚦe kiᛝ of ᚦe Goᚦs
Gunar spake
2
Firᛥ ᚦe hᛠrt of Hogni
ᛲal ye lay in my hands
Al blᛳdy from ᚦe brᛠᛥ
of ᚦe bold one cut
Wiᚦ kenbitiᛝ sword
from ᚦe son of ᚦe kiᛝ
23
ᚦey cut out ᚦe hᛠrt
from ᚦe brᛠᛥ of Hjali
On a plater ᚦey bore it
and brought it to Gunar
24
ᚦen Gunar spake forᚦ
ᚦe lord of ᚦe folk
Here have I ᚦe hᛠrt
of Hjali ᚦe craven
Unlike to ᚦe hᛠrt
of Hogni ᚦe valiant
For it trembles ᛥil
as it ᛥands on ᚦe plater
Twice more did it tremble
in ᚦe brᛠᛥ of ᚦe man
25
ᚦen Hogni laughed
when ᚦey cut out ᚦe hᛠrt
Of ᚦe liviᛝ helmhamerer
tᛠrs he had not
On a plater ᚦey bore it
and brought it to Gunar
26
ᚦen Gunar spake forᚦ
ᚦe spᛠr of ᚦe Nifluᛝs
Here have I ᚦe hᛠrt
of Hogni ᚦe valiant
Unlike to ᚦe hᛠrt
of Hjali ᚦe craven
Litle it trembles
as it lies on ᚦe plater
ᛥil les did it tremble
when it lay in his brᛠᛥ
27
So diᛥant Atli
from al mens eyes
ᛲalt ᚦou be as ᚦou
from ᚦe gold
28
To no one save me
is ᚦe secret known
Of ᚦe Nifluᛝs hoard
now Hogni is dᛠd
Of old ᚦere were two
while we twain were alive
Now is none but I
for I only am liviᛝ
29
ᚦe swift Rhine ᛲal hold
ᚦe ᛥrifegold of herᛟs
ᚦat once was ᚦe gods
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ of ᚦe Nifluᛝs
In ᚦe depᚦs of ᚦe waters
ᚦe dᛠᚦriᛝs ᛲal gliter
And not ᛲine on ᚦe hands
of ᚦe Huniᛲ men
Atli spake
30
Ye ᛲal briᛝ ᚦe wagon
for now is he bound
31
On ᚦe loᛝmaned Glaum
rode Atli ᚦe grᛠt
About him were wariors
But Guᚦrun akin
to ᚦe gods of slaughter
Yielded not to her tᛠrs
in ᚦe hal of tumult
Guᚦrun spake
32
It ᛲal go wiᚦ ᚦe Atli
as wiᚦ Gunar ᚦou heldeᛥ
ᚦe oaᚦs oftimes sworn
and of old made firm
By ᚦe sun in ᚦe souᚦ
by Sigtyrs mountain
By ᚦe horse of ᚦe reᛥbed
and ᚦe riᛝ of Ul
3
ᚦen ᚦe champer of bits
drew ᚦe chieftain grᛠt
ᚦe goldguarder down
to ᚦe place of dᛠᚦ
34
By ᚦe wariors hoᛥ
was ᚦe liviᛝ hero
Caᛥ in ᚦe den
where crawliᛝ about
Wiᚦin were serpents
but sᛳn did Gunar
Wiᚦ his hand in wraᚦ
on ᚦe harpᛥriᛝs smite
ᚦe ᛥriᛝs resounded
so ᛲal a hero
A riᛝbrᛠker gold
from his enemies guard
35 ᚦen Atli rode
on his ᛠrᚦtrᛠdiᛝ ᛥed
Sekiᛝ his home
from ᚦe slaughterplace
ᚦere was clater of hᛳfs
of ᚦe ᛥeds in ᚦe court
And ᚦe claᛲiᛝ of arms
as ᚦey came from ᚦe field
36
Out ᚦen came Guᚦrun
to metiᛝ wiᚦ Atli
Wiᚦ a golden bᛠker
as gift to ᚦe monarch
ᚦou mayᛥ ᛠt now chieftain
wiᚦin ᚦy dweliᛝ
Bliᚦely wiᚦ Guᚦrun
youᛝ bᛠᛥs freᛲ slaughtered
37
ᚦe winehᛠvy alecups
of Atli resounded
When ᚦere in ᚦe hal
ᚦe Huniᛲ youᚦs clamored
And ᚦe wariors bᛠrded
ᚦe brave ones entered
38
ᚦen in came ᚦe ᛲiniᛝ one
and drink ᛲe bore ᚦem
Unwiliᛝ and biter
brought ᛲe fᛳd to ᚦe warior
Til in scorn to ᚦe whitefaced
Atli did ᛲe spᛠk
39
ᚦou giver of swords
of ᚦy sons ᚦe hᛠrts
Al hᛠvy wiᚦ blᛳd
in honey ᚦou haᛥ ᛠten
ᚦou ᛲalt ᛥomach ᚦou hero
ᚦe fleᛲ of ᚦe slain
To ᛠt at ᚦy fᛠᛥ
and to send to ᚦy folowers
40
ᚦou ᛲalt never cal
to ᚦy knes again
Erp or Eitil
when mery wiᚦ ale
ᚦou ᛲalt never se
in ᚦeir sᛠts again
ᚦe ᛲarers of gold
ᚦeir lances ᛲapiᛝ
Clipiᛝ ᚦe manes
or mindiᛝ ᚦeir ᛥeds
41
ᚦere was clamor on ᚦe benches
and ᚦe cry of men
ᚦe claᛲiᛝ of wᛠpons
and wepiᛝ of ᚦe Huns
Save for Guᚦrun only
ᛲe wept not ever
For her bᛠrfierce broᚦers
or ᚦe boys so dᛠr
So youᛝ and so unhapy
whom wiᚦ Atli ᛲe had
42
Gold did ᛲe scater
ᚦe swanwhite one
And riᛝs of red gold
to ᚦe folowers gave ᛲe
ᚦe fate ᛲe let grow
and ᚦe ᛲiniᛝ wᛠlᚦ go
Nor spared ᛲe ᚦe trᛠsure
of ᚦe temple itself
43
Unwise ᚦen was Atli
he had drunk to wildnes
No wᛠpon did he have
and of Guᚦrun bewared not
Oft ᚦeir play was beter
when boᚦ in gladnes
ᛠch oᚦer embraced
amoᛝ princes al
4
Wiᚦ her sword ᛲe gave blᛳd
for ᚦe bed to drink
Wiᚦ her dᛠᚦdᛠliᛝ hand
and ᚦe hounds ᛲe lᛳsed
ᚦe ᚦrals ᛲe awakened
and a firebrand ᚦrew
In ᚦe dᛳr of ᚦe hal
so veᛝᛠnce ᛲe had
45
To ᚦe flames ᛲe gave al
who yet were wiᚦin
And from Myrkheim had come
from ᚦe murder of Gunar
ᚦe timbers old fel
ᚦe temple was in flames
ᚦe dweliᛝ of ᚦe Buᚦluᛝs
and ᚦe ᛲieldmaids burned
ᚦey were slain in ᚦe house
in ᚦe hot flames ᚦey sank
46
Now ᚦe tale is al told
nor in later time
Wil a woman in byrnie
aveᛝe so her broᚦers
ᚦe fair one to ᚦre
of ᚦe kiᛝs of ᚦe folk
Brought ᚦe dᛳm of dᛠᚦ
ere herself ᛲe died
ᛥil more is told in ᚦe Grenland balad of Atli
