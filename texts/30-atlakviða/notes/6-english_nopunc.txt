Guthrun Gjukis daughter avenged her brothers as has become well known 
She slew first Atlis sons and thereafter she slew Atli and burned the hall with his whole company 
Concerning this was the following poem made 
1
Atli sent 
of old to Gunnar
A keenwitted rider 
Knefröth did men call him
To Gjukis home came he 
and to Gunnars dwelling
With benches round the hearth 
and to the beer so sweet 
2
Then the followers hiding 
their falseness all drank
Their wine in the warhall 
of the Huns wrath wary
And Knefröth spake loudly 
his words were crafty
The hero from the south 
on the high bench sitting 
3
Now Atli has sent me 
his errand to ride
On my bitchamping steed 
through Myrkwood the secret
To bid you Gunnar 
to his benches to come
With helms round the hearth 
and Atlis home seek 
4
Shields shall ye choose there 
and shafts made of ashwood
Goldadorned helmets 
and slaves out of Hunland
Silvergilt saddlecloths 
shirts of bright scarlet
With lances and spears too 
and bitchamping steeds 
5
The field shall be given you 
of wide Gnitaheith
With loudringing lances 
and stems goldoerlaid
Treasures full huge 
and the home of Danp
And the mighty forest 
that Myrkwood is called 
6
His head turned Gunnar 
and to Hogni he said
What thy counsel young hero 
when such things we hear
No gold do I know 
on Gnitaheith lying
So fair that other 
its equal we have not 
7
We have seven halls 
each of swords is full
And all of gold 
is the hilt of each
My steed is the swiftest 
my sword is sharpest
My bows adorn benches 
my byrnies are golden
My helm is the brightest 
that came from Kjars hall
Mine own is better 
than all the Huns treasure 
Hogni spake
8
What seeks she to say 
that she sends us a ring
Woven with a wolfs hair 
methinks it gives warning
In the red ring a hair 
of the heathdweller found I
Wolflike shall our road be 
if we ride on this journey 
9
Not eager were his comrades 
nor the men of his kin
The wise nor the wary 
nor the warriors bold
But Gunnar spake forth 
as befitted a king
Noble in the beerhall 
and bitter his scorn 
10
Stand forth now Fjornir 
and hither on the floor
The beakers all golden 
shalt thou bring to the warriors
11
The wolves then shall rule 
the wealth of the Niflungs
Wolves aged and greyhued 
if Gunnar is lost
And blackcoated bears 
with rending teeth bite
And make glad the dogs 
if Gunnar returns not 
12
A following gallant 
fared forth with the ruler
Yet they wept as their home 
with the hero they left
And the little heir 
of Hogni called loudly
Go safe now ye wise ones 
wherever ye will 
13
Then let the bold heroes 
their bitchamping horses
On the mountains gallop 
and through Myrkwood the secret
All Hunland was shaken 
where the hardsouled ones rode
On the whipfearers fared they 
through fields that were green 
14
Then they saw Atlis halls 
and his watchtowers high
On the walls so lofty 
stood the warriors of Buthli
The hall of the southrons 
with seats was surrounded
With targets bound 
and shields full bright
15
Mid weapons and lances 
did Atli his wine
In the warhall drink 
without were his watchmen
For Gunnar they waited 
if forth he should go
With their ringing spears 
they would fight with the ruler 
16
This their sister saw 
as soon as her brothers
Had entered the hall 
little ale had she drunk
Betrayed art thou Gunnar 
what guard hast thou hero
Gainst the plots of the Huns 
from the hall flee swiftly 
17
Brother twere far better 
to have come in byrnie
With thy household helmed 
to see Atlis home
And to sit in the saddle 
all day neath the sun
That the swordnorns might weep 
for the deathpale warriors
And the Hunnish shieldmaids 
might shun not the sword
And send Atli himself 
to the den of the snakes
Now the den of the snakes 
for thee is destined 
Gunnar spake
18
Too late is it sister 
to summon the Niflungs
Long is it to come 
to the throng of our comrades
The heroes gallant 
from the hills of the Rhine 
19
Then Gunnar they seized 
and they set him in chains
The Burgundians king 
and fast they bound him 
20
Hogni slew seven 
with sword so keen
And an eighth he flung 
in the fire hot
A hero should fight 
with his foemen thus
As Hogni strove 
in Gunnars behalf 
21
The leader they asked 
if his life he fain
With gold would buy 
the king of the Goths 
Gunnar spake
22
First the heart of Hogni 
shall ye lay in my hands
All bloody from the breast 
of the bold one cut
With keenbiting sword 
from the son of the king 
23
They cut out the heart 
from the breast of Hjalli
On a platter they bore it 
and brought it to Gunnar 
24
Then Gunnar spake forth 
the lord of the folk
Here have I the heart 
of Hjalli the craven
Unlike to the heart 
of Hogni the valiant
For it trembles still 
as it stands on the platter
Twice more did it tremble 
in the breast of the man 
25
Then Hogni laughed 
when they cut out the heart
Of the living helmhammerer 
tears he had not
On a platter they bore it 
and brought it to Gunnar 
26
Then Gunnar spake forth 
the spear of the Niflungs
Here have I the heart 
of Hogni the valiant
Unlike to the heart 
of Hjalli the craven
Little it trembles 
as it lies on the platter
Still less did it tremble 
when it lay in his breast 
27
So distant Atli 
from all mens eyes
Shalt thou be as thou 
     from the gold
28
To no one save me 
is the secret known
Of the Niflungs hoard 
now Hogni is dead
Of old there were two 
while we twain were alive
Now is none but I 
for I only am living 
29
The swift Rhine shall hold 
the strifegold of heroes
That once was the gods 
the wealth of the Niflungs
In the depths of the waters 
the deathrings shall glitter
And not shine on the hands 
of the Hunnish men 
Atli spake
30
Ye shall bring the wagon 
for now is he bound 
31
On the longmaned Glaum 
rode Atli the great
About him were warriors 
But Guthrun akin 
to the gods of slaughter
Yielded not to her tears 
in the hall of tumult 
Guthrun spake
32
It shall go with thee Atli 
as with Gunnar thou heldest
The oaths ofttimes sworn 
and of old made firm
By the sun in the south 
by Sigtyrs mountain
By the horse of the restbed 
and the ring of Ull 
33
Then the champer of bits 
drew the chieftain great
The goldguarder down 
to the place of death
34
By the warriors host 
was the living hero
Cast in the den 
where crawling about
Within were serpents 
but soon did Gunnar
With his hand in wrath 
on the harpstrings smite
The strings resounded 
so shall a hero
A ringbreaker gold 
from his enemies guard 
35 Then Atli rode 
on his earthtreading steed
Seeking his home 
from the slaughterplace
There was clatter of hoofs 
of the steeds in the court
And the clashing of arms 
as they came from the field 
36
Out then came Guthrun 
to meeting with Atli
With a golden beaker 
as gift to the monarch
Thou mayst eat now chieftain 
within thy dwelling
Blithely with Guthrun 
young beasts fresh slaughtered 
37
The wineheavy alecups 
of Atli resounded
When there in the hall 
the Hunnish youths clamored
And the warriors bearded 
the brave ones entered 
38
Then in came the shining one 
and drink she bore them
Unwilling and bitter 
brought she food to the warrior
Till in scorn to the whitefaced 
Atli did she speak 
39
Thou giver of swords 
of thy sons the hearts
All heavy with blood 
in honey thou hast eaten
Thou shalt stomach thou hero 
the flesh of the slain
To eat at thy feast 
and to send to thy followers 
40
Thou shalt never call 
to thy knees again
Erp or Eitil 
when merry with ale
Thou shalt never see 
in their seats again
The sharers of gold 
their lances shaping
Clipping the manes 
or minding their steeds 
41
There was clamor on the benches 
and the cry of men
The clashing of weapons 
and weeping of the Huns
Save for Guthrun only 
she wept not ever
For her bearfierce brothers 
or the boys so dear
So young and so unhappy 
whom with Atli she had 
42
Gold did she scatter 
the swanwhite one
And rings of red gold 
to the followers gave she
The fate she let grow 
and the shining wealth go
Nor spared she the treasure 
of the temple itself 
43
Unwise then was Atli 
he had drunk to wildness
No weapon did he have 
and of Guthrun bewared not
Oft their play was better 
when both in gladness
Each other embraced 
among princes all 
44
With her sword she gave blood 
for the bed to drink
With her deathdealing hand 
and the hounds she loosed
The thralls she awakened 
and a firebrand threw
In the door of the hall 
so vengeance she had 
45
To the flames she gave all 
who yet were within
And from Myrkheim had come 
from the murder of Gunnar
The timbers old fell 
the temple was in flames
The dwelling of the Buthlungs 
and the shieldmaids burned
They were slain in the house 
in the hot flames they sank 
46
Now the tale is all told 
nor in later time
Will a woman in byrnie 
avenge so her brothers
The fair one to three 
of the kings of the folk
Brought the doom of death 
ere herself she died 
Still more is told in the Greenland ballad of Atli
