Guᚦrun Gjukis daughter aveᛝed her broᚦers as has become well known
ᛲe slew firᛥ Atlis sons and ᚦerᛠfter ᛲe slew Atli and burned ᚦe hall wiᚦ his whole company
Concerniᛝ ᚦis was ᚦe followiᛝ pᛟm made
1
Atli sent
of old to Gunnar
A keenwitted rider
Knefröᚦ did men call him
To Gjukis home came he
and to Gunnars dwelliᛝ
Wiᚦ benches round ᚦe hᛠrᚦ
and to ᚦe beer so sweet
2
ᚦen ᚦe followers hidiᛝ
ᚦeir falseness all drank
ᚦeir wine in ᚦe warhall
of ᚦe Huns wraᚦ wary
And Knefröᚦ spake loudly
his words were crafty
ᚦe hero from ᚦe souᚦ
on ᚦe high bench sittiᛝ
3
Now Atli has sent me
his errand to ride
On my bitchampiᛝ ᛥeed
ᚦrough Myrkwᛳd ᚦe secret
To bid you Gunnar
to his benches to come
Wiᚦ helms round ᚦe hᛠrᚦ
and Atlis home seek
4
ᛲields ᛲall ye chᛳse ᚦere
and ᛲafts made of aᛲwᛳd
Goldadorned helmets
and slaves out of Hunland
Silvergilt saddlecloᚦs
ᛲirts of bright scarlet
Wiᚦ lances and spᛠrs tᛳ
and bitchampiᛝ ᛥeeds
5
ᚦe field ᛲall be given you
of wide Gnitaheiᚦ
Wiᚦ loudriᛝiᛝ lances
and ᛥems goldᛟrlaid
Trᛠsures full huge
and ᚦe home of Danp
And ᚦe mighty foreᛥ
ᚦat Myrkwᛳd is called
6
His hᛠd turned Gunnar
and to Hogni he said
What ᚦy counsel youᛝ hero
when such ᚦiᛝs we hᛠr
No gold do I know
on Gnitaheiᚦ lyiᛝ
So fair ᚦat oᚦer
its equal we have not
7
We have seven halls
ᛠch of swords is full
And all of gold
is ᚦe hilt of ᛠch
My ᛥeed is ᚦe swifteᛥ
my sword is ᛲarpeᛥ
My bows adorn benches
my byrnies are golden
My helm is ᚦe brighteᛥ
ᚦat came from Kjars hall
Mine own is better
ᚦan all ᚦe Huns trᛠsure
Hogni spake
8
What seeks ᛲe to say
ᚦat ᛲe sends us a riᛝ
Woven wiᚦ a wolfs hair
meᚦinks it gives warniᛝ
In ᚦe red riᛝ a hair
of ᚦe hᛠᚦdweller found I
Wolflike ᛲall our road be
if we ride on ᚦis journey
9
Not ᛠger were his comrades
nor ᚦe men of his kin
ᚦe wise nor ᚦe wary
nor ᚦe warriors bold
But Gunnar spake forᚦ
as befitted a kiᛝ
Noble in ᚦe beerhall
and bitter his scorn
10
ᛥand forᚦ now Fjornir
and hiᚦer on ᚦe flᛳr
ᚦe bᛠkers all golden
ᛲalt ᚦou briᛝ to ᚦe warriors
11
ᚦe wolves ᚦen ᛲall rule
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ of ᚦe Nifluᛝs
Wolves aged and greyhued
if Gunnar is loᛥ
And blackcoated bᛠrs
wiᚦ rendiᛝ teeᚦ bite
And make glad ᚦe dogs
if Gunnar returns not
12
A followiᛝ gallant
fared forᚦ wiᚦ ᚦe ruler
Yet ᚦey wept as ᚦeir home
wiᚦ ᚦe hero ᚦey left
And ᚦe little heir
of Hogni called loudly
Go safe now ye wise ones
wherever ye will
13
ᚦen let ᚦe bold herᛟs
ᚦeir bitchampiᛝ horses
On ᚦe mountains gallop
and ᚦrough Myrkwᛳd ᚦe secret
All Hunland was ᛲaken
where ᚦe hardsouled ones rode
On ᚦe whipfᛠrers fared ᚦey
ᚦrough fields ᚦat were green
14
ᚦen ᚦey saw Atlis halls
and his watchtowers high
On ᚦe walls so lofty
ᛥᛳd ᚦe warriors of Buᚦli
ᚦe hall of ᚦe souᚦrons
wiᚦ sᛠts was surrounded
Wiᚦ targets bound
and ᛲields full bright
15
Mid wᛠpons and lances
did Atli his wine
In ᚦe warhall drink
wiᚦout were his watchmen
For Gunnar ᚦey waited
if forᚦ he ᛲould go
Wiᚦ ᚦeir riᛝiᛝ spᛠrs
ᚦey would fight wiᚦ ᚦe ruler
16
ᚦis ᚦeir siᛥer saw
as sᛳn as her broᚦers
Had entered ᚦe hall
little ale had ᛲe drunk
Betrayed art ᚦou Gunnar
what guard haᛥ ᚦou hero
Gainᛥ ᚦe plots of ᚦe Huns
from ᚦe hall flee swiftly
17
Broᚦer twere far better
to have come in byrnie
Wiᚦ ᚦy household helmed
to see Atlis home
And to sit in ᚦe saddle
all day nᛠᚦ ᚦe sun
ᚦat ᚦe swordnorns might weep
for ᚦe dᛠᚦpale warriors
And ᚦe Hunniᛲ ᛲieldmaids
might ᛲun not ᚦe sword
And send Atli himself
to ᚦe den of ᚦe snakes
Now ᚦe den of ᚦe snakes
for ᚦee is deᛥined
Gunnar spake
18
Tᛳ late is it siᛥer
to summon ᚦe Nifluᛝs
Loᛝ is it to come
to ᚦe ᚦroᛝ of our comrades
ᚦe herᛟs gallant
from ᚦe hills of ᚦe Rhine
19
ᚦen Gunnar ᚦey seized
and ᚦey set him in chains
ᚦe Burgundians kiᛝ
and faᛥ ᚦey bound him
20
Hogni slew seven
wiᚦ sword so keen
And an eighᚦ he fluᛝ
in ᚦe fire hot
A hero ᛲould fight
wiᚦ his fᛟmen ᚦus
As Hogni ᛥrove
in Gunnars behalf
21
ᚦe lᛠder ᚦey asked
if his life he fain
Wiᚦ gold would buy
ᚦe kiᛝ of ᚦe Goᚦs
Gunnar spake
22
Firᛥ ᚦe hᛠrt of Hogni
ᛲall ye lay in my hands
All blᛳdy from ᚦe brᛠᛥ
of ᚦe bold one cut
Wiᚦ keenbitiᛝ sword
from ᚦe son of ᚦe kiᛝ
23
ᚦey cut out ᚦe hᛠrt
from ᚦe brᛠᛥ of Hjalli
On a platter ᚦey bore it
and brought it to Gunnar
24
ᚦen Gunnar spake forᚦ
ᚦe lord of ᚦe folk
Here have I ᚦe hᛠrt
of Hjalli ᚦe craven
Unlike to ᚦe hᛠrt
of Hogni ᚦe valiant
For it trembles ᛥill
as it ᛥands on ᚦe platter
Twice more did it tremble
in ᚦe brᛠᛥ of ᚦe man
25
ᚦen Hogni laughed
when ᚦey cut out ᚦe hᛠrt
Of ᚦe liviᛝ helmhammerer
tᛠrs he had not
On a platter ᚦey bore it
and brought it to Gunnar
26
ᚦen Gunnar spake forᚦ
ᚦe spᛠr of ᚦe Nifluᛝs
Here have I ᚦe hᛠrt
of Hogni ᚦe valiant
Unlike to ᚦe hᛠrt
of Hjalli ᚦe craven
Little it trembles
as it lies on ᚦe platter
ᛥill less did it tremble
when it lay in his brᛠᛥ
27
So diᛥant Atli
from all mens eyes
ᛲalt ᚦou be as ᚦou
from ᚦe gold
28
To no one save me
is ᚦe secret known
Of ᚦe Nifluᛝs hoard
now Hogni is dᛠd
Of old ᚦere were two
while we twain were alive
Now is none but I
for I only am liviᛝ
29
ᚦe swift Rhine ᛲall hold
ᚦe ᛥrifegold of herᛟs
ᚦat once was ᚦe gods
ᚦe wᛠlᚦ of ᚦe Nifluᛝs
In ᚦe depᚦs of ᚦe waters
ᚦe dᛠᚦriᛝs ᛲall glitter
And not ᛲine on ᚦe hands
of ᚦe Hunniᛲ men
Atli spake
30
Ye ᛲall briᛝ ᚦe wagon
for now is he bound
31
On ᚦe loᛝmaned Glaum
rode Atli ᚦe grᛠt
About him were warriors
But Guᚦrun akin
to ᚦe gods of slaughter
Yielded not to her tᛠrs
in ᚦe hall of tumult
Guᚦrun spake
32
It ᛲall go wiᚦ ᚦee Atli
as wiᚦ Gunnar ᚦou heldeᛥ
ᚦe oaᚦs ofttimes sworn
and of old made firm
By ᚦe sun in ᚦe souᚦ
by Sigtyrs mountain
By ᚦe horse of ᚦe reᛥbed
and ᚦe riᛝ of Ull
33
ᚦen ᚦe champer of bits
drew ᚦe chieftain grᛠt
ᚦe goldguarder down
to ᚦe place of dᛠᚦ
34
By ᚦe warriors hoᛥ
was ᚦe liviᛝ hero
Caᛥ in ᚦe den
where crawliᛝ about
Wiᚦin were serpents
but sᛳn did Gunnar
Wiᚦ his hand in wraᚦ
on ᚦe harpᛥriᛝs smite
ᚦe ᛥriᛝs resounded
so ᛲall a hero
A riᛝbrᛠker gold
from his enemies guard
35 ᚦen Atli rode
on his ᛠrᚦtrᛠdiᛝ ᛥeed
Seekiᛝ his home
from ᚦe slaughterplace
ᚦere was clatter of hᛳfs
of ᚦe ᛥeeds in ᚦe court
And ᚦe claᛲiᛝ of arms
as ᚦey came from ᚦe field
36
Out ᚦen came Guᚦrun
to meetiᛝ wiᚦ Atli
Wiᚦ a golden bᛠker
as gift to ᚦe monarch
ᚦou mayᛥ ᛠt now chieftain
wiᚦin ᚦy dwelliᛝ
Bliᚦely wiᚦ Guᚦrun
youᛝ bᛠᛥs freᛲ slaughtered
37
ᚦe winehᛠvy alecups
of Atli resounded
When ᚦere in ᚦe hall
ᚦe Hunniᛲ youᚦs clamored
And ᚦe warriors bᛠrded
ᚦe brave ones entered
38
ᚦen in came ᚦe ᛲiniᛝ one
and drink ᛲe bore ᚦem
Unwilliᛝ and bitter
brought ᛲe fᛳd to ᚦe warrior
Till in scorn to ᚦe whitefaced
Atli did ᛲe spᛠk
39
ᚦou giver of swords
of ᚦy sons ᚦe hᛠrts
All hᛠvy wiᚦ blᛳd
in honey ᚦou haᛥ ᛠten
ᚦou ᛲalt ᛥomach ᚦou hero
ᚦe fleᛲ of ᚦe slain
To ᛠt at ᚦy fᛠᛥ
and to send to ᚦy followers
40
ᚦou ᛲalt never call
to ᚦy knees again
Erp or Eitil
when merry wiᚦ ale
ᚦou ᛲalt never see
in ᚦeir sᛠts again
ᚦe ᛲarers of gold
ᚦeir lances ᛲapiᛝ
Clippiᛝ ᚦe manes
or mindiᛝ ᚦeir ᛥeeds
41
ᚦere was clamor on ᚦe benches
and ᚦe cry of men
ᚦe claᛲiᛝ of wᛠpons
and weepiᛝ of ᚦe Huns
Save for Guᚦrun only
ᛲe wept not ever
For her bᛠrfierce broᚦers
or ᚦe boys so dᛠr
So youᛝ and so unhappy
whom wiᚦ Atli ᛲe had
42
Gold did ᛲe scatter
ᚦe swanwhite one
And riᛝs of red gold
to ᚦe followers gave ᛲe
ᚦe fate ᛲe let grow
and ᚦe ᛲiniᛝ wᛠlᚦ go
Nor spared ᛲe ᚦe trᛠsure
of ᚦe temple itself
43
Unwise ᚦen was Atli
he had drunk to wildness
No wᛠpon did he have
and of Guᚦrun bewared not
Oft ᚦeir play was better
when boᚦ in gladness
ᛠch oᚦer embraced
amoᛝ princes all
44
Wiᚦ her sword ᛲe gave blᛳd
for ᚦe bed to drink
Wiᚦ her dᛠᚦdᛠliᛝ hand
and ᚦe hounds ᛲe lᛳsed
ᚦe ᚦralls ᛲe awakened
and a firebrand ᚦrew
In ᚦe dᛳr of ᚦe hall
so veᛝᛠnce ᛲe had
45
To ᚦe flames ᛲe gave all
who yet were wiᚦin
And from Myrkheim had come
from ᚦe murder of Gunnar
ᚦe timbers old fell
ᚦe temple was in flames
ᚦe dwelliᛝ of ᚦe Buᚦluᛝs
and ᚦe ᛲieldmaids burned
ᚦey were slain in ᚦe house
in ᚦe hot flames ᚦey sank
46
Now ᚦe tale is all told
nor in later time
Will a woman in byrnie
aveᛝe so her broᚦers
ᚦe fair one to ᚦree
of ᚦe kiᛝs of ᚦe folk
Brought ᚦe dᛳm of dᛠᚦ
ere herself ᛲe died
ᛥill more is told in ᚦe Greenland ballad of Atli
