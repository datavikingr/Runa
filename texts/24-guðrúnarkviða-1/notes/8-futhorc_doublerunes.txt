Guᚦrun sat by ᚦe dᛠd Sigurᚦ
ᛲe did not weep as oᚦer women but her hᛠrt was nᛠr to burᛥiᛝ wiᚦ grief
ᚦe men and women came to her to console her but ᚦat was not ᛠsy to do
It is told of men ᚦat Guᚦrun had ᛠten of Fafnirs hᛠrt and ᚦat ᛲe under ᛥᛳd ᚦe speech of birds
ᚦis is a pᛟm about Guᚦrun

1
ᚦen did Guᚦrun
ᚦink to die
When ᛲe by Sigurᚦ
sorrowiᛝ sat
Tᛠrs ᛲe had not
nor wruᛝ her hands
Nor ever wailed
as oᚦer women

2
To her ᚦe warriors
wise ᚦere came
Loᛝiᛝ her hᛠvy
wᛟ to lighten
Grieviᛝ could not
Guᚦrun weep
So sad her hᛠrt
it seemed would brᛠk

3
ᚦen ᚦe wives
of ᚦe warriors came
Goldadorned
and Guᚦrun sought
ᛠch one ᚦen
of her own grief spoke
ᚦe bittereᛥ pain
ᛲe had ever borne

4
ᚦen spake Gjaflaug
Gjukis siᛥer
Moᛥ joyless of all
on ᛠrᚦ am I
Husbands five
were from me taken
Two daughters ᚦen
and siᛥers ᚦree
Broᚦers eight
yet I have lived

5
Grieviᛝ could not
Guᚦrun weep
Such grief ᛲe had
for her husband dᛠd
And so grim her hᛠrt
by ᚦe heros body

6
ᚦen Herborg spake
ᚦe queen of ᚦe Huns
I have a grᛠter
grief to tell
My seven sons
in ᚦe souᚦern land
And my husband fell
in fight all eight
Faᚦer and moᚦer
and broᚦers four
Amid ᚦe waves
ᚦe wind once smote
And ᚦe sᛠs craᛲed ᚦrough
ᚦe sides of ᚦe ᛲip

7
ᚦe bodies all
wiᚦ my own hands ᚦen
I decked for ᚦe grave
and ᚦe dᛠd I buried
A halfyᛠr brought me
ᚦis to bᛠr
And no one came
to comfort me

8
ᚦen bound I was
and taken in war
A sorrow yet
in ᚦe same halfyᛠr
ᚦey bade me deck
and bind ᚦe ᛲᛟs
Of ᚦe wife of ᚦe monarch
every morn

9
In jᛠlous rage
her wraᚦ ᛲe spake
And bᛠt me oft
wiᚦ hᛠvy blows
Never a better
lord I knew
And never a woman
worse I found

10
Grieviᛝ could not
Guᚦrun weep
Such grief ᛲe had
for her husband dᛠd
And so grim her hᛠrt
by ᚦe heros body

11
ᚦen spake Gollrond
Gjukis daughter
ᚦy wisdom finds not
my foᛥermoᚦer
ᚦe way to comfort
ᚦe wife so youᛝ
ᛲe bade ᚦem uncover
ᚦe warriors corpse

12
ᚦe ᛲroud ᛲe lifted
from Sigurᚦ layiᛝ
His wellloved hᛠd
on ᚦe knees of his wife
Lᛳk on ᚦy loved one
and lay ᚦy lips
To his as if yet
ᚦe hero lived

13
Once alone did
Guᚦrun lᛳk
His hair all clotted
wiᚦ blᛳd beheld
ᚦe blinded eyes
ᚦat once ᛲone bright
ᚦe heros brᛠᛥ
ᚦat ᚦe blade had pierced

14
ᚦen Guᚦrun bent
on her pillow bowed
Her hair was lᛳsened
her cheek was hot
And ᚦe tᛠrs like raindrops
downward ran

15
ᚦen Guᚦrun daughter
of Gjuki wept
And ᚦrough her tresses
flowed ᚦe tᛠrs
And from ᚦe court
came ᚦe cry of geese
ᚦe birds so fair
of ᚦe heros bride

16
ᚦen Gollrond spake
ᚦe daughter of Gjuki
Never a grᛠter
love I knew
ᚦan yours amoᛝ
all men on ᛠrᚦ
Nowhere waᛥ happy
at home or abroad
Siᛥer mine
wiᚦ Sigurᚦ away
Guᚦrun spake

17
So was my Sigurᚦ
ᛟr Gjukis sons
As ᚦe spᛠrleek grown
above ᚦe grass
Or ᚦe jewel bright
borne on ᚦe band
ᚦe precious ᛥone
ᚦat princes wᛠr

18
To ᚦe lᛠder of men
I loftier seemed
And higher ᚦan all
of Herjans maids
As little now
as ᚦe lᛠf I am
On ᚦe willow haᛝiᛝ
my hero is dᛠd

19
In his sᛠt in his bed
I see no more
My hᛠrts true friend
ᚦe fault is ᚦeirs
ᚦe sons of Gjuki
for all my grief
ᚦat so ᚦeir siᛥer
sorely weeps

20
So ᛲall your land
its people lose
As ye have kept
your oaᚦs of yore
Gunnar no joy
ᚦe gold ᛲall give ᚦee
ᚦe riᛝs ᛲall sᛳn
ᚦy slayers be
Who swareᛥ oaᚦs
wiᚦ Sigurᚦ once

21
In ᚦe court was grᛠter
gladness ᚦen
ᚦe day my Sigurᚦ
Grani saddled
And went forᚦ Brynhilds
hand to win
ᚦat woman ill
in an evil hour

22
ᚦen Brynhild spake
ᚦe daughter of Buᚦli
May ᚦe witch now husband
and children want
Who Guᚦrun lᛳsed
ᚦy tᛠrs at laᛥ
And wiᚦ magic today
haᚦ made ᚦee spᛠk

23
ᚦen Gollrond daughter
of Gjuki spake
Spᛠk not such words
ᚦou hated woman
Bane of ᚦe noble
ᚦou eer haᛥ been
Borne ᚦou art
on an evil wave
Sorrow haᛥ brought
to seven kiᛝs
And many a woman
haᛥ loveless made

24
ᚦen Brynhild daughter
of Buᚦli spake
Atli is guilty
of all ᚦe sorrow
Son of Buᚦli
and broᚦer of mine
When we saw in ᚦe hall
of ᚦe Hunniᛲ race
ᚦe flame of ᚦe snakes bed
flaᛲ round ᚦe hero
For ᚦe journey since
full sore have I paid
And ever I seek
ᚦe sight to forget

25
By ᚦe pillars ᛲe ᛥᛳd
and gaᚦered her ᛥreᛝᚦ
From ᚦe eyes of Brynhild
Buᚦlis daughter
Fire ᚦere burned
and venom ᛲe brᛠᚦed
When ᚦe wounds ᛲe saw
on Sigurᚦ ᚦen

Guᚦrun went ᚦence away to a foreᛥ in ᚦe waᛥe
and journeyed all ᚦe way to Denmark
and was ᚦere seven halfyᛠrs wiᚦ ᚦora daughter of Hokon
Brynhild would not live after Sigurᚦ
ᛲe had eight of her ᚦralls slain and five serviᛝwomen
ᚦen ᛲe killed her self wiᚦ a sword
as is told in ᚦe ᛲort Lay of Sigurᚦ
