Guᚦrun sat by ᚦe dᛠd Sigurᚦ
ᛲe did not wep as oᚦer women but her hᛠrt was nᛠr to burᛥiᛝ wiᚦ grief
ᚦe men and women came to her to console her but ᚦat was not ᛠsy to do
It is told of men ᚦat Guᚦrun had ᛠten of Fafnirs hᛠrt and ᚦat ᛲe under ᛥᛳd ᚦe spech of birds
ᚦis is a pᛟm about Guᚦrun

1
ᚦen did Guᚦrun
ᚦink to die
When ᛲe by Sigurᚦ
sorowiᛝ sat
Tᛠrs ᛲe had not
nor wruᛝ her hands
Nor ever wailed
as oᚦer women

2
To her ᚦe wariors
wise ᚦere came
Loᛝiᛝ her hᛠvy
wᛟ to lighten
Grieviᛝ could not
Guᚦrun wep
So sad her hᛠrt
it semed would brᛠk

3
ᚦen ᚦe wives
of ᚦe wariors came
Goldadorned
and Guᚦrun sought
ᛠch one ᚦen
of her own grief spoke
ᚦe bitereᛥ pain
ᛲe had ever borne

4
ᚦen spake Gjaflaug
Gjukis siᛥer
Moᛥ joyles of al
on ᛠrᚦ am I
Husbands five
were from me taken
Two daughters ᚦen
and siᛥers ᚦre
Broᚦers eight
yet I have lived

5
Grieviᛝ could not
Guᚦrun wep
Such grief ᛲe had
for her husband dᛠd
And so grim her hᛠrt
by ᚦe heros body

6
ᚦen Herborg spake
ᚦe quen of ᚦe Huns
I have a grᛠter
grief to tel
My seven sons
in ᚦe souᚦern land
And my husband fel
in fight al eight
Faᚦer and moᚦer
and broᚦers four
Amid ᚦe waves
ᚦe wind once smote
And ᚦe sᛠs craᛲed ᚦrough
ᚦe sides of ᚦe ᛲip

7
ᚦe bodies al
wiᚦ my own hands ᚦen
I decked for ᚦe grave
and ᚦe dᛠd I buried
A halfyᛠr brought me
ᚦis to bᛠr
And no one came
to comfort me

8
ᚦen bound I was
and taken in war
A sorow yet
in ᚦe same halfyᛠr
ᚦey bade me deck
and bind ᚦe ᛲᛟs
Of ᚦe wife of ᚦe monarch
every morn

9
In jᛠlous rage
her wraᚦ ᛲe spake
And bᛠt me oft
wiᚦ hᛠvy blows
Never a beter
lord I knew
And never a woman
worse I found

10
Grieviᛝ could not
Guᚦrun wep
Such grief ᛲe had
for her husband dᛠd
And so grim her hᛠrt
by ᚦe heros body

1
ᚦen spake Golrond
Gjukis daughter
ᚦy wisdom finds not
my foᛥermoᚦer
ᚦe way to comfort
ᚦe wife so youᛝ
ᛲe bade ᚦem uncover
ᚦe wariors corpse

12
ᚦe ᛲroud ᛲe lifted
from Sigurᚦ layiᛝ
His weloved hᛠd
on ᚦe knes of his wife
Lᛳk on ᚦy loved one
and lay ᚦy lips
To his as if yet
ᚦe hero lived

13
Once alone did
Guᚦrun lᛳk
His hair al cloted
wiᚦ blᛳd beheld
ᚦe blinded eyes
ᚦat once ᛲone bright
ᚦe heros brᛠᛥ
ᚦat ᚦe blade had pierced

14
ᚦen Guᚦrun bent
on her pilow bowed
Her hair was lᛳsened
her chek was hot
And ᚦe tᛠrs like raindrops
downward ran

15
ᚦen Guᚦrun daughter
of Gjuki wept
And ᚦrough her treses
flowed ᚦe tᛠrs
And from ᚦe court
came ᚦe cry of gese
ᚦe birds so fair
of ᚦe heros bride

16
ᚦen Golrond spake
ᚦe daughter of Gjuki
Never a grᛠter
love I knew
ᚦan yours amoᛝ
al men on ᛠrᚦ
Nowhere waᛥ hapy
at home or abroad
Siᛥer mine
wiᚦ Sigurᚦ away
Guᚦrun spake

17
So was my Sigurᚦ
ᛟr Gjukis sons
As ᚦe spᛠrlek grown
above ᚦe gras
Or ᚦe jewel bright
borne on ᚦe band
ᚦe precious ᛥone
ᚦat princes wᛠr

18
To ᚦe lᛠder of men
I loftier semed
And higher ᚦan al
of Herjans maids
As litle now
as ᚦe lᛠf I am
On ᚦe wilow haᛝiᛝ
my hero is dᛠd

19
In his sᛠt in his bed
I se no more
My hᛠrts true friend
ᚦe fault is ᚦeirs
ᚦe sons of Gjuki
for al my grief
ᚦat so ᚦeir siᛥer
sorely weps

20
So ᛲal your land
its people lose
As ye have kept
your oaᚦs of yore
Gunar no joy
ᚦe gold ᛲal give ᚦe
ᚦe riᛝs ᛲal sᛳn
ᚦy slayers be
Who swareᛥ oaᚦs
wiᚦ Sigurᚦ once

21
In ᚦe court was grᛠter
gladnes ᚦen
ᚦe day my Sigurᚦ
Grani sadled
And went forᚦ Brynhilds
hand to win
ᚦat woman il
in an evil hour

2
ᚦen Brynhild spake
ᚦe daughter of Buᚦli
May ᚦe witch now husband
and children want
Who Guᚦrun lᛳsed
ᚦy tᛠrs at laᛥ
And wiᚦ magic today
haᚦ made ᚦe spᛠk

23
ᚦen Golrond daughter
of Gjuki spake
Spᛠk not such words
ᚦou hated woman
Bane of ᚦe noble
ᚦou er haᛥ ben
Borne ᚦou art
on an evil wave
Sorow haᛥ brought
to seven kiᛝs
And many a woman
haᛥ loveles made

24
ᚦen Brynhild daughter
of Buᚦli spake
Atli is guilty
of al ᚦe sorow
Son of Buᚦli
and broᚦer of mine
When we saw in ᚦe hal
of ᚦe Huniᛲ race
ᚦe flame of ᚦe snakes bed
flaᛲ round ᚦe hero
For ᚦe journey since
ful sore have I paid
And ever I sek
ᚦe sight to forget

25
By ᚦe pilars ᛲe ᛥᛳd
and gaᚦered her ᛥreᛝᚦ
From ᚦe eyes of Brynhild
Buᚦlis daughter
Fire ᚦere burned
and venom ᛲe brᛠᚦed
When ᚦe wounds ᛲe saw
on Sigurᚦ ᚦen

Guᚦrun went ᚦence away to a foreᛥ in ᚦe waᛥe
and journeyed al ᚦe way to Denmark
and was ᚦere seven halfyᛠrs wiᚦ ᚦora daughter of Hokon
Brynhild would not live after Sigurᚦ
ᛲe had eight of her ᚦrals slain and five serviᛝwomen
ᚦen ᛲe kiled her self wiᚦ a sword
as is told in ᚦe ᛲort Lay of Sigurᚦ
