Gunar and Hogni ᚦen tᛳk al ᚦe gold ᚦat Fafnir had had
ᚦere was ᛥrife betwen ᚦe Gjukuᛝs and Atli
for he held ᚦe Gjukuᛝs guilty of Brynhilds dᛠᚦ
It was agred ᚦat ᚦey ᛲould give him Guᚦrun as wife and ᚦey gave her a draught of forgetfulnes to drink before ᛲe would consent to be weded to Atli
ᚦe sons of Atli were Erp and Eitil and Svanhild was ᚦe daughter of Sigurᚦ and Guᚦrun
Kiᛝ Atli invited Gunar and Hogni to come to him and sent as meseᛝer Viᛝi or Knefröᚦ
Guᚦrun was aware of trᛠchery and sent wiᚦ him a mesage in runes ᚦat ᚦey ᛲould not come
and as a token ᛲe sent to Hogni ᚦe riᛝ Andvaranaut and tied a wolfs hair in it
Gunar had sought Odrun Atlis siᛥer for his wife but had her not
ᚦen he maried Glaumvor and Hognis wife was Koᛥbera
ᚦeir sons were Solar and Snᚫvar and Gjuki
And when ᚦe Gjukuᛝs came to Atli ᚦen Guᚦrun be sought her sons to plᛠd for ᚦe lives of boᚦ ᚦe Gjukuᛝs but ᚦey would not do it
Hognis hᛠrt was cut out and Gunar was caᛥ into ᚦe serpents den
He smote on ᚦe harp and put ᚦe serpents to slep but an ader ᛥuᛝ him in ᚦe liver
Kiᛝ ᚦjoᚦrek was wiᚦ Atli and had loᛥ moᛥ of his men
ᚦjoᚦrek and Guᚦrun lamented ᚦeir griefs togeᚦer
ᛲe spoke to him sayiᛝ
1
A maid of maids
my moᚦer bore me
Bright in my bower
my broᚦers I loved
Til Gjuki dowered
me wiᚦ gold
Dowered wiᚦ gold
and to Sigurᚦ gave me
2
So Sigurᚦ rose
ᛟr Gjukis sons
As ᚦe lek grows gren
above ᚦe gras
Or ᚦe ᛥag ᛟr al
ᚦe bᛠᛥs doᚦ ᛥand
Or as glowred gold
above silver gray
3
Til my broᚦers let me
no loᛝer have
ᚦe beᛥ of herᛟs
my husband to be
Slep ᚦey could not
or quarels setle
Til Sigurᚦ ᚦey
at laᛥ had slain
4
From ᚦe ᚦiᛝ ran Grani
wiᚦ ᚦunderiᛝ fet
But ᚦence did Sigurᚦ
himself come never
Covered wiᚦ swᛠt
was ᚦe sadlebᛠrer
Wont ᚦe wariors
weight to bᛠr
5
Wepiᛝ I sought
wiᚦ Grani to spᛠk
Wiᚦ tᛠrwet cheks
for ᚦe tale I asked
ᚦe hᛠd of Grani
was bowed to ᚦe gras
ᚦe ᛥed knew wel
his maᛥer was slain
6
Loᛝ I waited
and pondered wel
Ere ever ᚦe kiᛝ
for tidiᛝs I asked
7
His hᛠd bowed Gunar
but Hogni told
ᚦe news ful sore
of Sigurᚦ slain
Hewed to dᛠᚦ
at our hands he lies
Gotᚦorms slayer
given to wolves
8
On ᚦe souᚦern road
ᚦou ᛲalt Sigurᚦ se
Where hᛠr ᚦou canᛥ
ᚦe ravens cry
ᚦe ᛠgles cry
as fᛳd ᚦey crave
And about ᚦy husband
wolves are howliᛝ
9
Why doᛥ ᚦou Hogni
such a horor
Let me hᛠr
al joyles left
Ravens yet
ᚦy hᛠrt ᛲal rend
In a land ᚦat never
ᚦou haᛥ known
10
Few ᚦe words
of Hogni were
Biter his hᛠrt
from hᛠvy sorow
Grᛠter Guᚦrun
ᚦy grief ᛲal be
If ᚦe ravens so
my hᛠrt ᛲal rend
1
From him who spake
I turned me sᛳn
In ᚦe wᛳds to find
what ᚦe wolves had left
Tᛠrs I had not
nor wruᛝ my bands
Nor wailiᛝ went
as oᚦer women
When by Sigurᚦ
slain I sat
12
Never so black
had semed ᚦe night
As when in sorow
by Sigurᚦ I sat
ᚦe wolves
13
Beᛥ of al
meᚦought twould be
If I my life
could only lose
Or like to birchwᛳd
burned might be
14
From ᚦe mountain forᚦ
five days I fared
Til Hoalfs hal
so high I saw
Seven halfyᛠrs
wiᚦ ᚦora I ᛥayed
Hokons daughter
in Denmark ᚦen
15
Wiᚦ gold ᛲe broidered
to briᛝ me joy
Souᚦern hals
and Daniᛲ swans
On ᚦe tapeᛥry wove we
wariors deds
And ᚦe heros ᚦanes
on our handiwork
Flaᛲiᛝ ᛲields
and fighters armed
Swordᚦroᛝ helmᚦroᛝ
ᚦe hoᛥ of ᚦe kiᛝ
16
Sigmunds ᛲip
by ᚦe land was sailiᛝ
Golden ᚦe figurehᛠd
gay ᚦe bᛠks
On board we wove
ᚦe wariors fariᛝ
Sigar and Sigeir

17
ᚦen Grimhild asked
ᚦe Goᚦic quen
Wheᚦer wiliᛝly
would I
18
Her nedlework caᛥ ᛲe
aside and caled
Her sons to ask
wiᚦ ᛥern resolve
Who amends to ᚦeir siᛥer
would make for her son
Or ᚦe wife requite
for her husband kiled
19
Rᛠdy was Gunar
gold to give
Amends for my hurt
and Hogni tᛳ
ᚦen would ᛲe know
who now would go
ᚦe horse to sadle
ᚦe wagon to harnes
ᚦe horse to ride
ᚦe hawk to fly
And ᛲafts from bows
of yew to ᛲᛳt
20
Valdar kiᛝ
of ᚦe Danes was come
Wiᚦ Jarizleif Eymoᚦ
and Jarizskar
In like princes

ᚦe loᛝbᛠrd men
wiᚦ mantles red
ᛲort ᚦeir mailcoats
mighty ᚦeir helms
Swords at ᚦeir belts
and brown ᚦeir hair
21
ᛠch to give me
gifts was fain
Gifts to give
and gᛳdly spech
Comfort so
for my sorows grᛠt
To briᛝ ᚦey tried
but I truᛥed ᚦem not
2
A draught did Grimhild
give me to drink
Biter and cold
I forgot my cares
For miᛝled ᚦerein was magic ᛠrᚦ
Icecold sᛠ
and ᚦe blᛳd of swine
23
In ᚦe cup were runes
of every kind
Writen and redened
I could not rᛠd ᚦem
A hᛠᚦerfiᛲ
from ᚦe Hadiᛝs land
An ᛠr uncut
and ᚦe entrails of bᛠᛥs
24
Much evil was brewed
wiᚦin ᚦe ber
Blosoms of tres
and acorns burned
Dew of ᚦe hᛠrᚦ
and holy entrails
ᚦe liver of swine
al grief to alay
25
ᚦen I forgot
when ᚦe draught ᚦey gave me
ᚦere in ᚦe hal
my husbands slayiᛝ
On ᚦeir knes ᚦe kiᛝs
al ᚦre did knel
Ere ᛲe herself
to spᛠk began
26
Guᚦrun gold

ᚦe wᛠlᚦ ᚦat once
ᚦy faᚦers was
Riᛝs to have
and Hloᚦvers hals
And ᚦe haᛝiᛝs al

27
Huniᛲ women
skiled in wᛠviᛝ
Who gold make fair
to give ᚦe joy
And ᚦe wᛠlᚦ of Buᚦli
ᚦine ᛲal be
Goldecked one
as Atlis wife
Guᚦrun spake
28
A husband now
I wil not have
Nor wife of Brynhilds
broᚦer be
It besems me not
wiᚦ Buᚦlis son
Hapy to be
and heirs to bᛠr
Grimhild spake
29
Sek not on men
to aveᛝe ᚦy sorows
ᚦough ᚦe blame at firᛥ
wiᚦ us haᚦ ben
Hapy ᛲalt be
as if boᚦ ᛥil lived
Sigurᚦ and Sigmund
if sons ᚦou bᛠreᛥ
Guᚦrun spake
30
Grimhild I may not
gladnes find
Nor hold forᚦ hopes
to herᛟs now
Since once ᚦe raven
and raveniᛝ wolf
Sigurᚦs hᛠrtsblᛳd
huᛝrily laped
Grimhild spake
31
Nobleᛥ of birᚦ

I have found for ᚦe
and foremoᛥ of al
Him ᛲalt ᚦou have
while life ᚦou haᛥ
Or husbandles be
if him ᚦou wilt chᛳse not
Guᚦrun spake
32
Sek not so ᛠgerly
me to send
To be a bride
of yon baneful race
On Gunar firᛥ
his wraᚦ ᛲal fal
And ᚦe hᛠrt wil he tᛠr
from Hognis brᛠᛥ
3
Wepiᛝ Grimhild
hᛠrd ᚦe words
ᚦat fate ful sore
for her sons foretold
And mighty wᛟ
for ᚦem ᛲould work
Lands I give ᚦe
wiᚦ al ᚦat live ᚦere
Vinbjorg is ᚦine
and Valbjorg tᛳ
Have ᚦem forever
but hᛠr me daughter
34
So muᛥ I do
as ᚦe kiᛝs besought
And againᛥ my wil
for my kinsmen wed
Ner wiᚦ my husband
joy I had
And my sons by my broᚦers
fate were saved not
35
I could not reᛥ
til of life I had robed
ᚦe warior bold
ᚦe maker of batles
36
Sᛳn on horseback
ᛠch hero was
And ᚦe foreign women
in wagons fariᛝ
A wek ᚦrough lands
so cold we went
And a second wek
ᚦe waves we smote
And a ᚦird ᚦrough lands
ᚦat water lacked
37
ᚦe warders now
on ᚦe lofty wals
Opened ᚦe gates
and in we rode
38
Atli woke me
for ever I semed
Of biternes ful
for my broᚦers dᛠᚦ
Atli spake
39
Now from slep
ᚦe Norns have waked me
Wiᚦ visions of teror
to ᚦe wil I tel ᚦem
Meᚦought ᚦou Guᚦrun
Gjukis daughter
Wiᚦ poisoned blade

Guᚦrun spake
40
Fire a drᛠm
of ᛥel ᛲal folow
And wilful pride
one of womans wraᚦ
A baneful sore
I ᛲal burn from ᚦe
And tend and hᛠl ᚦe
ᚦough hated ᚦou art
Atli spake
41
Of plants I drᛠmed
in ᚦe garden drᛳpiᛝ
ᚦat fain would I have
ful high to grow
Plucked by ᚦe rᛳts
and red wiᚦ blᛳd
ᚦey brought ᚦem hiᚦer
and bade me ᛠt
42
I drᛠmed my hawks
from my hand had flown
ᛠger for fᛳd
to an evil house
I drᛠmed ᚦeir hᛠrts
wiᚦ honey I ate
Soaked in blᛳd
and hᛠvy my sorow
43
Hounds I drᛠmed
from my hand I lᛳsed
Loud in huᛝer
and pain ᚦey howled
ᚦeir fleᛲ meᚦought

And ᚦeir bodies now

And of ᚦe hᛠds

Die ᚦey ᛲal

A few nights hence
and ᚦe folk ᛲal have ᚦem

45
On my bed I sank

Wᛠry wiᚦ wᛟ
