Heithrek was the name of a king 
whose daughter was called Borgny 
Vilmund was the name of the man who was her lover 
She could not give birth to a child until Oddrun Atlis sister had come to her 
Oddrun had been beloved of Gunnar son of Gjuki 
About this story is the following poem 
1
I have heard it told 
in olden tales
How a maiden came 
to Morningland
No one of all 
on earth above
To Heithreks daughter 
help could give 
2
This Oddrun learned 
the sister of Atli
That sore the maidens 
sickness was
The bitbearer forth 
from his stall she brought
And the saddle laid 
on the steed so black 
3
She let the horse go 
oer the level ground
Till she reached the hall 
that loftily rose
And in she went 
from the end of the hall
From the weary steed 
the saddle she took
Hear now the speech 
that first she spake 
4
What news on earth 
Or what has happened 
in Hunland now
A servingmaid spake
Here Borgny lies 
in bitter pain
Thy friend and Oddrun 
thy help would find 
Oddrun spake
5
Who worked this woe 
for the woman thus
Or why so sudden 
is Borgny sick 
The servingmaid spake
Vilmund is he 
the heroes friend
Who wrapped the woman 
in bedclothes warm
For winters five 
yet her father knew not 
6
Then no more 
they spake methinks
She went at the knees 
of the woman to sit
With magic Oddrun 
and mightily Oddrun
Chanted for Borgny 
potent charms 
7
At last were born 
a boy and girl
Son and daughter 
of Hognis slayer
Then speech the woman 
so weak began
Nor said she aught 
ere this she spake 
8
So may the holy 
ones thee help
Frigg and Freyja 
and favoring gods
As thou hast saved me 
from sorrow now 
Oddrun spake
9
I came not hither 
to help thee thus
Because thou ever 
my aid didst earn
I fulfilled the oath 
that of old I swore
That aid to all 
I should ever bring
When they shared the wealth 
the warriors had 
Borgny spake
10
Wild art thou Oddrun 
and witless now
That so in hatred 
to me thou speakest
I followed thee 
where thou didst fare
As we had been born 
of brothers twain
Oddrun spake
11
I remember the evil 
one eve thou spakest
When a draught I gave 
to Gunnar then
Thou didst say that never 
such a deed
By maid was done 
save by me alone
12
Then the sorrowing woman 
sat her down
To tell the grief 
of her troubles great
13
Happy I grew 
in the heros hall
As the warriors wished 
and they loved me well
Glad I was 
of my fathers gifts
For winters five 
while my father lived
14
These were the words 
the weary king
Ere he died 
spake last of all
He bade me with red gold 
dowered to be
And to Grimhilds son 
in the South be wedded
15
But Brynhild the helm 
he bade to wear
A wishmaid bright 
he said she should be
For a nobler maid 
would never be born
On earth he said 
if death should spare her 
16
At her weaving Brynhild 
sat in her bower
Lands and folk 
alike she had
The earth and heaven 
high resounded
When Fafnirs slayer 
the city saw 
17
Then battle was fought 
with the foreign swords
And the city was broken 
that Brynhild had
Not long thereafter 
but all too soon
Their evil wiles 
full well she knew 
18
Woeful for this 
her vengeance was
As so we learned 
to our sorrow all
In every land 
shall all men hear
How herself at Sigurths 
side she slew 
19
Love to Gunnar 
then I gave
To the breaker of rings 
as Brynhild might 
To Atli rings 
so red they offered
And mighty gifts 
to my brother would give
20
Fifteen dwellings 
fain would he give
For me and the burden 
that Grani bore 
But Atli said 
he would never receive
Marriage gold 
from Gjukis son
21
Yet could we not 
our love oercome
And my head I laid 
on the heros shoulder 
Many there were 
of kinsmen mine
Who said that together 
us they had seen
22
Atli said 
that never I
Would evil plan 
or ill deed do 
But none may this 
of another think
Or surely speak 
when love is shared 
23
Soon his men 
did Atli send
In the murky wood 
on me to spy
Thither they came 
where they should not come
Where beneath one cover 
close we lay 
24
To the warriors ruddy 
rings we offered
That nought to Atli 
eer they should say
But swiftly home 
they hastened thence
And eager all 
to Atli told 
25
But close from Guthrun 
kept they hid
What first of all 
she ought to have known
26
Great was the clatter 
of gilded hoofs
When Gjukis sons 
through the gateway rode
The heart they hewed 
from Hogni then
And the other they cast 
in the serpents cave 
27
The hero wise 
on his harp then smote
For help from me 
in his heart yet hoped
The highborn king 
might come to him
28
Alone was I gone 
to Geirmund then
The draught to mix 
and ready to make 
Sudden I heard 
from Hlesey clear
How in sorrow the strings 
of the harp resounded
29
I bade the servingmaids 
ready to be
For I longed the heros 
life to save 
Across the sound 
the boats we sailed
Till we saw the whole 
of Atlis home 
30
Then crawling the evil 
woman came
Atlis mother 
may she ever rot
And hard she bit 
to Gunnars heart
So I could not help 
the hero brave 
31
Oft have I wondered 
how after this
Serpentsbed goddess 
I still might live
For well I loved 
the warrior brave
The giver of swords 
as my very self 
32
Thou didst see and listen 
the while I said
The mighty grief 
that was mine and theirs
Each man lives 
as his longing wills
Oddruns lament 
is ended now
