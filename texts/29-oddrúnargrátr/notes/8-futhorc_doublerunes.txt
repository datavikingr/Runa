Heiᚦrek was ᚦe name of a kiᛝ
whose daughter was called Borgny
Vilmund was ᚦe name of ᚦe man who was her lover
ᛲe could not give birᚦ to a child until Oddrun Atlis siᛥer had come to her
Oddrun had been beloved of Gunnar son of Gjuki
About ᚦis ᛥory is ᚦe followiᛝ pᛟm
1
I have hᛠrd it told
in olden tales
How a maiden came
to Morniᛝland
No one of all
on ᛠrᚦ above
To Heiᚦreks daughter
help could give
2
ᚦis Oddrun lᛠrned
ᚦe siᛥer of Atli
ᚦat sore ᚦe maidens
sickness was
ᚦe bitbᛠrer forᚦ
from his ᛥall ᛲe brought
And ᚦe saddle laid
on ᚦe ᛥeed so black
3
ᛲe let ᚦe horse go
ᛟr ᚦe level ground
Till ᛲe rᛠched ᚦe hall
ᚦat loftily rose
And in ᛲe went
from ᚦe end of ᚦe hall
From ᚦe wᛠry ᛥeed
ᚦe saddle ᛲe tᛳk
Hᛠr now ᚦe speech
ᚦat firᛥ ᛲe spake
4
What news on ᛠrᚦ
Or what has happened
in Hunland now
A serviᛝmaid spake
Here Borgny lies
in bitter pain
ᚦy friend and Oddrun
ᚦy help would find
Oddrun spake
5
Who worked ᚦis wᛟ
for ᚦe woman ᚦus
Or why so sudden
is Borgny sick
ᚦe serviᛝmaid spake
Vilmund is he
ᚦe herᛟs friend
Who wrapped ᚦe woman
in bedcloᚦes warm
For winters five
yet her faᚦer knew not
6
ᚦen no more
ᚦey spake meᚦinks
ᛲe went at ᚦe knees
of ᚦe woman to sit
Wiᚦ magic Oddrun
and mightily Oddrun
Chanted for Borgny
potent charms
7
At laᛥ were born
a boy and girl
Son and daughter
of Hognis slayer
ᚦen speech ᚦe woman
so wᛠk began
Nor said ᛲe aught
ere ᚦis ᛲe spake
8
So may ᚦe holy
ones ᚦee help
Frigg and Freyja
and favoriᛝ gods
As ᚦou haᛥ saved me
from sorrow now
Oddrun spake
9
I came not hiᚦer
to help ᚦee ᚦus
Because ᚦou ever
my aid didᛥ ᛠrn
I fulfilled ᚦe oaᚦ
ᚦat of old I swore
ᚦat aid to all
I ᛲould ever briᛝ
When ᚦey ᛲared ᚦe wᛠlᚦ
ᚦe warriors had
Borgny spake
10
Wild art ᚦou Oddrun
and witless now
ᚦat so in hatred
to me ᚦou spᛠkeᛥ
I followed ᚦee
where ᚦou didᛥ fare
As we had been born
of broᚦers twain
Oddrun spake
11
I remember ᚦe evil
one eve ᚦou spakeᛥ
When a draught I gave
to Gunnar ᚦen
ᚦou didᛥ say ᚦat never
such a deed
By maid was done
save by me alone
12
ᚦen ᚦe sorrowiᛝ woman
sat her down
To tell ᚦe grief
of her troubles grᛠt
13
Happy I grew
in ᚦe heros hall
As ᚦe warriors wiᛲed
and ᚦey loved me well
Glad I was
of my faᚦers gifts
For winters five
while my faᚦer lived
14
ᚦese were ᚦe words
ᚦe wᛠry kiᛝ
Ere he died
spake laᛥ of all
He bade me wiᚦ red gold
dowered to be
And to Grimhilds son
in ᚦe Souᚦ be wedded
15
But Brynhild ᚦe helm
he bade to wᛠr
A wiᛲmaid bright
he said ᛲe ᛲould be
For a nobler maid
would never be born
On ᛠrᚦ he said
if dᛠᚦ ᛲould spare her
16
At her wᛠviᛝ Brynhild
sat in her bower
Lands and folk
alike ᛲe had
ᚦe ᛠrᚦ and hᛠven
high resounded
When Fafnirs slayer
ᚦe city saw
17
ᚦen battle was fought
wiᚦ ᚦe foreign swords
And ᚦe city was broken
ᚦat Brynhild had
Not loᛝ ᚦerᛠfter
but all tᛳ sᛳn
ᚦeir evil wiles
full well ᛲe knew
18
Wᛟful for ᚦis
her veᛝᛠnce was
As so we lᛠrned
to our sorrow all
In every land
ᛲall all men hᛠr
How herself at Sigurᚦs
side ᛲe slew
19
Love to Gunnar
ᚦen I gave
To ᚦe brᛠker of riᛝs
as Brynhild might
To Atli riᛝs
so red ᚦey offered
And mighty gifts
to my broᚦer would give
20
Fifteen dwelliᛝs
fain would he give
For me and ᚦe burden
ᚦat Grani bore
But Atli said
he would never receive
Marriage gold
from Gjukis son
21
Yet could we not
our love ᛟrcome
And my hᛠd I laid
on ᚦe heros ᛲoulder
Many ᚦere were
of kinsmen mine
Who said ᚦat togeᚦer
us ᚦey had seen
22
Atli said
ᚦat never I
Would evil plan
or ill deed do
But none may ᚦis
of anoᚦer ᚦink
Or surely spᛠk
when love is ᛲared
23
Sᛳn his men
did Atli send
In ᚦe murky wᛳd
on me to spy
ᚦiᚦer ᚦey came
where ᚦey ᛲould not come
Where benᛠᚦ one cover
close we lay
24
To ᚦe warriors ruddy
riᛝs we offered
ᚦat nought to Atli
eer ᚦey ᛲould say
But swiftly home
ᚦey haᛥened ᚦence
And ᛠger all
to Atli told
25
But close from Guᚦrun
kept ᚦey hid
What firᛥ of all
ᛲe ought to have known
26
Grᛠt was ᚦe clatter
of gilded hᛳfs
When Gjukis sons
ᚦrough ᚦe gateway rode
ᚦe hᛠrt ᚦey hewed
from Hogni ᚦen
And ᚦe oᚦer ᚦey caᛥ
in ᚦe serpents cave
27
ᚦe hero wise
on his harp ᚦen smote
For help from me
in his hᛠrt yet hoped
ᚦe highborn kiᛝ
might come to him
28
Alone was I gone
to Geirmund ᚦen
ᚦe draught to mix
and rᛠdy to make
Sudden I hᛠrd
from Hlesey clᛠr
How in sorrow ᚦe ᛥriᛝs
of ᚦe harp resounded
29
I bade ᚦe serviᛝmaids
rᛠdy to be
For I loᛝed ᚦe heros
life to save
Across ᚦe sound
ᚦe boats we sailed
Till we saw ᚦe whole
of Atlis home
30
ᚦen crawliᛝ ᚦe evil
woman came
Atlis moᚦer
may ᛲe ever rot
And hard ᛲe bit
to Gunnars hᛠrt
So I could not help
ᚦe hero brave
31
Oft have I wondered
how after ᚦis
Serpentsbed goddess
I ᛥill might live
For well I loved
ᚦe warrior brave
ᚦe giver of swords
as my very self
32
ᚦou didᛥ see and liᛥen
ᚦe while I said
ᚦe mighty grief
ᚦat was mine and ᚦeirs
ᛠch man lives
as his loᛝiᛝ wills
Oddruns lament
is ended now
