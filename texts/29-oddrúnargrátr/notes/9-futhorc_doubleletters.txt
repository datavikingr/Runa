Heiᚦrek was ᚦe name of a kiᛝ
whose daughter was caled Borgny
Vilmund was ᚦe name of ᚦe man who was her lover
ᛲe could not give birᚦ to a child until Odrun Atlis siᛥer had come to her
Odrun had ben beloved of Gunar son of Gjuki
About ᚦis ᛥory is ᚦe folowiᛝ pᛟm
1
I have hᛠrd it told
in olden tales
How a maiden came
to Morniᛝland
No one of al
on ᛠrᚦ above
To Heiᚦreks daughter
help could give
2
ᚦis Odrun lᛠrned
ᚦe siᛥer of Atli
ᚦat sore ᚦe maidens
sicknes was
ᚦe bitbᛠrer forᚦ
from his ᛥal ᛲe brought
And ᚦe sadle laid
on ᚦe ᛥed so black
3
ᛲe let ᚦe horse go
ᛟr ᚦe level ground
Til ᛲe rᛠched ᚦe hal
ᚦat loftily rose
And in ᛲe went
from ᚦe end of ᚦe hal
From ᚦe wᛠry ᛥed
ᚦe sadle ᛲe tᛳk
Hᛠr now ᚦe spech
ᚦat firᛥ ᛲe spake
4
What news on ᛠrᚦ
Or what has hapened
in Hunland now
A serviᛝmaid spake
Here Borgny lies
in biter pain
ᚦy friend and Odrun
ᚦy help would find
Odrun spake
5
Who worked ᚦis wᛟ
for ᚦe woman ᚦus
Or why so suden
is Borgny sick
ᚦe serviᛝmaid spake
Vilmund is he
ᚦe herᛟs friend
Who wraped ᚦe woman
in bedcloᚦes warm
For winters five
yet her faᚦer knew not
6
ᚦen no more
ᚦey spake meᚦinks
ᛲe went at ᚦe knes
of ᚦe woman to sit
Wiᚦ magic Odrun
and mightily Odrun
Chanted for Borgny
potent charms
7
At laᛥ were born
a boy and girl
Son and daughter
of Hognis slayer
ᚦen spech ᚦe woman
so wᛠk began
Nor said ᛲe aught
ere ᚦis ᛲe spake
8
So may ᚦe holy
ones ᚦe help
Frig and Freyja
and favoriᛝ gods
As ᚦou haᛥ saved me
from sorow now
Odrun spake
9
I came not hiᚦer
to help ᚦe ᚦus
Because ᚦou ever
my aid didᛥ ᛠrn
I fulfiled ᚦe oaᚦ
ᚦat of old I swore
ᚦat aid to al
I ᛲould ever briᛝ
When ᚦey ᛲared ᚦe wᛠlᚦ
ᚦe wariors had
Borgny spake
10
Wild art ᚦou Odrun
and witles now
ᚦat so in hatred
to me ᚦou spᛠkeᛥ
I folowed ᚦe
where ᚦou didᛥ fare
As we had ben born
of broᚦers twain
Odrun spake
1
I remember ᚦe evil
one eve ᚦou spakeᛥ
When a draught I gave
to Gunar ᚦen
ᚦou didᛥ say ᚦat never
such a ded
By maid was done
save by me alone
12
ᚦen ᚦe sorowiᛝ woman
sat her down
To tel ᚦe grief
of her troubles grᛠt
13
Hapy I grew
in ᚦe heros hal
As ᚦe wariors wiᛲed
and ᚦey loved me wel
Glad I was
of my faᚦers gifts
For winters five
while my faᚦer lived
14
ᚦese were ᚦe words
ᚦe wᛠry kiᛝ
Ere he died
spake laᛥ of al
He bade me wiᚦ red gold
dowered to be
And to Grimhilds son
in ᚦe Souᚦ be weded
15
But Brynhild ᚦe helm
he bade to wᛠr
A wiᛲmaid bright
he said ᛲe ᛲould be
For a nobler maid
would never be born
On ᛠrᚦ he said
if dᛠᚦ ᛲould spare her
16
At her wᛠviᛝ Brynhild
sat in her bower
Lands and folk
alike ᛲe had
ᚦe ᛠrᚦ and hᛠven
high resounded
When Fafnirs slayer
ᚦe city saw
17
ᚦen batle was fought
wiᚦ ᚦe foreign swords
And ᚦe city was broken
ᚦat Brynhild had
Not loᛝ ᚦerᛠfter
but al tᛳ sᛳn
ᚦeir evil wiles
ful wel ᛲe knew
18
Wᛟful for ᚦis
her veᛝᛠnce was
As so we lᛠrned
to our sorow al
In every land
ᛲal al men hᛠr
How herself at Sigurᚦs
side ᛲe slew
19
Love to Gunar
ᚦen I gave
To ᚦe brᛠker of riᛝs
as Brynhild might
To Atli riᛝs
so red ᚦey ofered
And mighty gifts
to my broᚦer would give
20
Fiften dweliᛝs
fain would he give
For me and ᚦe burden
ᚦat Grani bore
But Atli said
he would never receive
Mariage gold
from Gjukis son
21
Yet could we not
our love ᛟrcome
And my hᛠd I laid
on ᚦe heros ᛲoulder
Many ᚦere were
of kinsmen mine
Who said ᚦat togeᚦer
us ᚦey had sen
2
Atli said
ᚦat never I
Would evil plan
or il ded do
But none may ᚦis
of anoᚦer ᚦink
Or surely spᛠk
when love is ᛲared
23
Sᛳn his men
did Atli send
In ᚦe murky wᛳd
on me to spy
ᚦiᚦer ᚦey came
where ᚦey ᛲould not come
Where benᛠᚦ one cover
close we lay
24
To ᚦe wariors rudy
riᛝs we ofered
ᚦat nought to Atli
er ᚦey ᛲould say
But swiftly home
ᚦey haᛥened ᚦence
And ᛠger al
to Atli told
25
But close from Guᚦrun
kept ᚦey hid
What firᛥ of al
ᛲe ought to have known
26
Grᛠt was ᚦe clater
of gilded hᛳfs
When Gjukis sons
ᚦrough ᚦe gateway rode
ᚦe hᛠrt ᚦey hewed
from Hogni ᚦen
And ᚦe oᚦer ᚦey caᛥ
in ᚦe serpents cave
27
ᚦe hero wise
on his harp ᚦen smote
For help from me
in his hᛠrt yet hoped
ᚦe highborn kiᛝ
might come to him
28
Alone was I gone
to Geirmund ᚦen
ᚦe draught to mix
and rᛠdy to make
Suden I hᛠrd
from Hlesey clᛠr
How in sorow ᚦe ᛥriᛝs
of ᚦe harp resounded
29
I bade ᚦe serviᛝmaids
rᛠdy to be
For I loᛝed ᚦe heros
life to save
Acros ᚦe sound
ᚦe boats we sailed
Til we saw ᚦe whole
of Atlis home
30
ᚦen crawliᛝ ᚦe evil
woman came
Atlis moᚦer
may ᛲe ever rot
And hard ᛲe bit
to Gunars hᛠrt
So I could not help
ᚦe hero brave
31
Oft have I wondered
how after ᚦis
Serpentsbed godes
I ᛥil might live
For wel I loved
ᚦe warior brave
ᚦe giver of swords
as my very self
32
ᚦou didᛥ se and liᛥen
ᚦe while I said
ᚦe mighty grief
ᚦat was mine and ᚦeirs
ᛠch man lives
as his loᛝiᛝ wils
Odruns lament
is ended now
