Sigurᚦ rode up on Hindarfjoll and turned souᚦward toward ᚦe land of ᚦe Franks
On ᚦe mountain he saw a grᛠt light as if fire were burniᛝ and ᚦe glow rᛠched up to hᛠven
And when he came ᚦiᚦer ᚦere ᛥᛳd a tower of ᛲields and above it was a banner
Sigurᚦ went into ᚦe ᛲieldtower and saw ᚦat a man lay ᚦere sleepiᛝ wiᚦ all his warwᛠpons
Firᛥ he tᛳk ᚦe helm from his hᛠd

ᚦe mailcoat was as faᛥ as if it had grown to ᚦe fleᛲ

ᚦen he tᛳk ᚦe mailcoat from her and ᛲe awoke and sat up and saw Sigurᚦ and said

„What bit ᚦrough ᚦe byrnie

Who made me free
of ᚦe fetters pale“
He answered
„Sigmunds son

„Loᛝ did I sleep
my slumber was loᛝ
And loᛝ are ᚦe griefs of life
Oᚦin decreed
ᚦat I could not brᛠk

Her name was Sigrdrifa and ᛲe was a Valkyrie
ᛲe said ᚦat two kiᛝs fought in battle
one was called Hjalmgunnar
an old man but a mighty warrior and Oᚦin had promised him ᚦe victory and
ᚦe oᚦer was Agnar
broᚦer of Auᚦa
None he found
who fain would ᛲield him
Sigrdrifa slew Hjalmgunnar in ᚦe battle
and Oᚦin pricked her wiᚦ ᚦe sleepᚦorn in puniᛲment for ᚦis and said ᚦat ᛲe ᛲould never ᚦerᛠfter win victory in battle but ᚦat ᛲe ᛲould be wedded
„And I said to him ᚦat I had made a vow in my turn ᚦat I would never marry a man who knew ᚦe mᛠniᛝ of fᛠr“
Sigurᚦ answered and asked her to tᛠch him wisdom if ᛲe knew of what tᛳk place in all ᚦe worlds
Sigrdrifa said
