Sigurth rode up on Hindarfjoll and turned southward toward the land of the Franks. 
On the mountain he saw a great light, as if fire were burning, and the glow reached up to heaven. 
And when he came thither, there stood a tower of shields, and above it was a banner. 
Sigurth went into the shield-tower, and saw that a man lay there sleeping with all his war-weapons. 
First he took the helm from his head, 
and then he saw that it was a woman. 
The mail-coat was as fast as if it had grown to the flesh. 
Then he cut the mail-coat from the head-opening downward, and out to both the arm-holes. 
Then he took the mail-coat from her, and she awoke, and sat up and saw Sigurth, and said: 

1.
„What bit through the byrnie? |
how was broken my sleep?
Who made me free |
of the fetters pale?“ 
He answered:
„Sigmund's son, |
with Sigurth's sword,
That late with flesh |
hath fed the ravens.“ 
Sigurth sat beside her and asked her name. 
She took a horn full of mead and gave him a memory-draught. 

2.
„Hail, day! |
Hail, sons of day!
And night and her daughter now!
Look on us here |
with loving eyes,
That waiting we victory win. 

3.
„Hail to the gods! |
Ye goddesses, hail,
And all the generous earth!
Give to us wisdom |
and goodly speech,
And healing hands, life-long.

4.
„Long did I sleep, |
my slumber was long,
And long are the griefs of life;
Othin decreed |
that I could not break
The heavy spells of sleep.“ 

Her name was Sigrdrifa, and she was a Valkyrie. 
She said that two kings fought in battle; 
one was called Hjalmgunnar, 
an old man but a mighty warrior, and Othin had promised him the victory, and 
The other was Agnar, |
brother of Autha,
None he found |
who fain would shield him. 
Sigrdrifa, slew Hjalmgunnar in the battle, 
and Othin pricked her with the sleep-thorn in punishment for this, and said that she should never thereafter win victory in battle, but that she should be wedded. 
„And I said to him that I had made a vow in my turn, that I would never marry a man who knew the meaning of fear.“ 
Sigurth answered and asked her to teach him wisdom, if she knew of what took place in all the worlds. 
Sigrdrifa said: 

5.
„Beer I bring thee, |
tree of battle,
Mingled of strength |
and mighty fame;
Charms it holds |
and healing signs,
Spells full good, |
and gladness-runes.“ 

6.
Winning-runes learn, |
if thou longest to win,
And the runes on thy sword-hilt write;
Some on the furrow, |
and some on the flat,
And twice shalt thou call on Tyr. 

7.
Ale-runes learn, |
that with lies the wife
Of another betray not thy trust;
On the horn thou shalt write, |
and the backs of thy hands,
And Need shalt mark on thy nails. 
Thou shalt bless the draught, |
and danger escape,
And cast a leek in the cup;
(For so I know |
thou never shalt see
Thy mead with evil mixed.) 

8.
Birth-runes learn, |
if help thou wilt lend,
The babe from the mother to bring;
On thy palms shalt write them, |
and round thy joints,
And ask the fates to aid. 

9.
Wave-runes learn, |
if well thou wouldst shelter
The sail-steeds out on the sea;
On the stem shalt thou write, |
and the steering blade,
And burn them into the oars;
Though high be the breakers, |
and black the waves,
Thou shalt safe the harbor seek. 

10.
Branch-runes learn, |
if a healer wouldst be,
And cure for wounds wouldst work;
On the bark shalt thou write, |
and on trees that be
With boughs to the eastward bent. 

11.
Speech-runes learn, |
that none may seek
To answer harm with hate;
Well he winds |
and weaves them all,
And sets them side by side,
At the judgment-place, |
when justice there
The folk shall fairly win. 

12.
Thought-runes learn, |
if all shall think
Thou art keenest minded of men.

13.
Them Hropt arranged, |
and them he wrote,
And them in thought he made,
Out of the draught |
that down had dropped
From the head of Heithdraupnir,
And the horn of Hoddrofnir. 

14.
On the mountain he stood |
with Brimir's sword,
On his head the helm he bore;
Then first the head |
of Mim spoke forth,
And words of truth it told. 

15.
He bade write on the shield |
before the shining goddess,
On Arvak's ear, |
and on Alsvith's hoof,
On the wheel of the car |
of Hrungnir's killer,
On Sleipnir's teeth, |
and the straps of the sledge. 

16.
On the paws of the bear, |
and on Bragi's tongue,
On the wolf's claws bared, |
and the eagle's beak,
On bloody wings, |
and bridge's end,
On freeing hands |
and helping foot-prints. 

17.
On glass and on gold, |
and on goodly charms,
In wine and in beer, |
and on well-loved seats,
On Gungnir's point, |
and on Grani's breast,
On the nails of Norns, |
and the night-owl's beak. 
18. Shaved off were the runes |
that of old were written,
And mixed with the holy mead,
And sent on ways so wide;
So the gods had them, |
so the elves got them,
And some for the Wanes so wise,
And some for mortal men. 

19.
Beech-runes are there, |
birth-runes are there,
And all the runes of ale,
And the magic runes of might;
Who knows them rightly |
and reads them true,
Has them himself to help;
Ever they aid,
Till the gods are gone. 
Brynhild spake:

20.
„Now shalt thou choose, |
for the choice is given,
Thou tree of the biting blade;
Speech or silence, |
'tis thine to say,
Our evil is destined all.“ 
Sigurth spake:

21.
„I shall not flee, |
though my fate be near,
I was born not a coward to be;
Thy loving word |
for mine will I win,
As long as I shall live.“ 

22.
Then first I rede thee, |
that free of guilt
Toward kinsmen ever thou art;
No vengeance have, |
though they work thee harm,
Reward after death thou shalt win. 

23.
Then second I rede thee, |
to swear no oath
If true thou knowest it not;
Bitter the fate |
of the breaker of troth,
And poor is the wolf of his word. 

24.
Then third I rede thee, |
that thou at the Thing
Shalt fight not in words with fools;
For the man unwise |
a worser word
Than he thinks doth utter oft. 

25.
Ill it is |
if silent thou art,
A coward born men call thee,
And truth mayhap they tell;
Seldom safe is fame,
Unless wide renown be won;
On the day thereafter |
send him to death,
Let him pay the price of his lies. 

26.
Then fourth I rede thee, |
if thou shalt find
A wily witch on thy road,
It is better to go |
than her guest to be,
Though night enfold thee fast. 

27.
Eyes that see |
need the sons of men
Who fight in battle fierce;
Oft witches evil |
sit by the way,
Who blade and courage blunt. 

28.
Then fifth I rede thee, |
though maidens fair
Thou seest on benches sitting,
Let the silver of kinship |
not rob thee of sleep,
And the kissing of women beware. 

29.
Then sixth I rede thee, |
if men shall wrangle,
And ale-talk rise to wrath,
No words with a drunken |
warrior have,
For wine steals many men's wits. 

30.
Brawls and ale |
full oft have been
An ill to many a man,
Death for some, |
and sorrow for some;
Full many the woes of men. 

31.
Then seventh I rede thee, |
if battle thou seekest
With a foe that is full of might;
It is better to fight |
than to burn alive
In the hall of the hero rich. 

32.
Then eighth I rede thee, |
that evil thou shun,
And beware of lying words;
Take not a maid, |
nor the wife of a man,
Nor lure them on to lust. 

33.
Then ninth I rede thee: |
burial render
If thou findest a fallen corpse,
Of sickness dead, |
or dead in the sea,
Or dead of weapons' wounds. 

34.
A bath shalt thou give them |
who corpses be,
And hands and head shalt wash;
Wipe them and comb, |
ere they go in the coffin,
And pray that they sleep in peace. 

35.
Then tenth I rede thee, |
that never thou trust
The word of the race of wolves,
(If his brother thou broughtest to death,
Or his father thou didst fell;)
Often a wolf |
in a son there is,
Though gold he gladly takes. 

36.
Battle and hate |
and harm, methinks,
Full seldom fall asleep;
Wits and weapons |
the warrior needs
If boldest of men he would be. 

37.
Then eleventh I rede thee, |
that wrath thou shun,
And treachery false with thy friends;
Not long the leader's |
life shall be,
For great are the foes he faces.
